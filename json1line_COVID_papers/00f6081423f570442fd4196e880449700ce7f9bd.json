Our work considers the importance of FAFH in the overall economy, and we also consider changes in agricultural production and trade that have occurred because of COVID-19. We gather data on actual changes to these components, as well as similar shocks to non-agricultural sectors, and employ a simulation model to estimate the impacts on gross domestic product (GDP). Results indicate that changes from agriculture due to COVID-19 have had a larger effect on the overall U.S. economy than the share of agriculture in the economy at the beginning of COVID-19. But the non-agricultural shocks still outweigh the impacts from agriculture by a magnitude of 3. Breaking the results down along the components, we find that the loss in FAFH expenditures is the largest contributor to the change in GDP resulting from shocks to agricultural markets and conclude that agricultural production/trade markets have been very resilient during the pandemic.

To do so, we examine several components of economic change pertaining to agriculture, and the entire economy, with a focus on capturing the demand, supply, and fiscal responses. We use data from the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) and Foreign Agricultural Service PS&D (Production, Supply and Distribution) to provide information on actual changes to agricultural production and trade that occurred in 2020, comparing values to those for 2019. These estimates indicate that agricultural production (and trade) slightly increased in 2020 despite COVID-19. i One important aspect of the link between agriculture and the economy-wide impacts of COVID-19 is for food away from home (FAFH). As noted in ERS (2020a), FAFH home expenditures in the U.S. declined 21% relative to the previous year. Given that this component of the economy provides employment for many, the macro-economic impacts from this expenditure reduction does generate a substantial GDP loss. We compare these impacts from agriculture with similar shocks for the entire economy (thus capturing the nonagricultural impact, and as will be explained later, the i We do note that there has been media coverage of supply issues in agriculture, in particular, closures of meat packing plants; but there is not enough evidence that these short-run disruptions severely impacted the agricultural sector, as described by the WASDE data. demand, supply, and fiscal responses) and find that the share of impact from agriculture is greatest for regions that have a large FAFH sector (e.g., the United States). In this instance, the impact from agriculture is still only one-third of the total economy shock, although this amount is higher than the 5.4% share of agriculture in the U.S. national economy. We further distill the agriculture results into impacts from the three shocks, finding that almost all notable GDP change is from FAFH.

In fact, all commodities have an increase in global production, except for cotton-which has been impacted by a reduction in clothing bought globally from various shutdowns (e.g., malls and other clothing outlets) and from working from home. It was noted in April 2020 (USDA 2020) that annual agricultural production was expected to be very good in the U.S., and according to the WASDE estimates, that outlook played out in crop production; although the U.S. had a decrease in cotton production, as well as sugar and wheat.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 919, "end": 922, "text": "iii", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Modeling Framework"}, {"text": "Many other regions had an increase in agricultural production.

Production is normally endogenous, but we swap production with taxes/subsidies in the model and directly shock production. To reach the given change in production, taxes/subsidies will change (i.e., a decrease in production will lead to an increase in taxes, i.e., this raises the price of the productmimicking essentially what happened with COVID-19 with higher costs of operating, in some cases with businesses shut down and/or implementing capacity restrictions). The revenues generated by this tax/subsidy are rebated back to households (as is done in Maliszewska, Mattoo, and van der Mensbrugghe 2020) to provide some of the fiscal response as detailed in that section. iv Even with this extra data, we are missing information on processed food and beverages and tobacco.

Overall, agricultural trade increased by 2.3%, although there was a decline in the agricultural sector most traded (processed food). There are other commodities that had decreases in trade relative to last year, including live animals (cattle and other animal products)-but those are traded in small numbers, plant-based fibers due to the lack of demand for clothing production, and beverages and tobacco from the reduction in demand for FAFH. The commodity that had the largest increase in trade is coarse grains, although it is also traded in small numbers. In terms of those traded in relatively large amounts (more than $20 billion a year), sugar had a large increase (a result of a large increase in exports from the two largest exporters: Brazil and India), as did oilseeds, wheat, and other meats. Other meats (in particular, pork) is one commodity where forces outside of COVID-19 could have impacted trade markets, as ASF impacted China's production (and imports), in addition to the Phase 1 trade deal with the United States. If we remove China's increased imports in this sector, other meat trade decreased by \u22128.2% in the rest of the world.

We directly impose the trade changes that occurred in 2020 in the model by letting the tax on imports adjust. As such, an increase in imports will mimic a reduction in trade costs, and a decrease in imports will mimic an increase in trade costs. An alternative approach, changing the trade costs of goods has been used by Maliszewska, Mattoo, and van der Mensbrugghe (2020); however, they must make assumptions on how much these costs might have changed. Our approach here actually provides an estimate of how much trade costs have changed (based on the changes in trade), which are available upon request from the authors. many of the stay-at-home orders resulted in the closures or partial closures of restaurants.

The largest increases in unemployment were in Sub-Saharan Africa and the United States. The United States started from a small rate of unemployment (4% at the beginning of 2020), but Sub-Saharan Africa is known for high rates of unemployment, so COVID-19 could have brought additional adverse impacts.

U.S. GDP decreased by 4%, whereas Europe had a 9.3% decline. These declines helped lead to the overall global decline of 5%. However, actual GDP indicates that China had an increase of 1.7% for 2020. China had a large decrease in GDP for the first quarter of 2020; however, an increase in the other three quarters led to their overall increase. The literature estimates for COVID-19 induced changes in GDP are in the next six columns of table 3 and are arranged in terms of ascending chronological order. As the results in table 3 indicate, the estimated changes in GDP decline grew over time as the pandemic continued, and there has been a more informed understanding of potential impacts. In particular, the estimates from Maliszewska, Mattoo, and van der Mensbrugghe (2020) are similar across regions, and are quite small, as is the lower range of the estimates from McKibbin and Fernando (2020). The first three of these columns represent estimates from CGE models, and the estimates from ADB (2020) have larger simulated impacts than the other two studies, as this research was completed months after the other two. However, that work overestimated the actual change in global GDP.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "The next three columns represent forecasts from various organizations (all studies were released in June), and they generally show larger declines than the McKibbin and Fernando (2020) and Maliszewska, Mattoo, and van der Mensbrugghe (2020) papers.

In addition, those two organizations (IMF and World Bank) got very close to estimating the actual change in global GDP. They do, however, overestimate the decline in U.S. GDP by 2% to 4%.

The U.S. has the smallest difference between the two and is the region with the second smallest estimated GDP decline but a relatively large decrease in the share of the GDP change from the agriculture shocks. To lend some insight into why this occurs, we consider the agriculture shocks independently (table 4) .

There are GDP changes greater than one quarter of a percent for some countries from the agricultural production shocks. Brazil has an increase due to the production gains they experienced for most commodities; India has an increase in production in sugar, which increased their GDP. Changes in GDP from agricultural trade are small across all regions; globally, there is only a small change in GDP from the trade shocks. For both production and trade, the U.S. has small changes in GDP, that is, production and trade are not the reason GDP decreases. Rather, the impacts on U.S. GDP (and most other region GDP) from agriculture come from shocks to FAFH. The U.S. has the largest expenditures on FAFH of all regions and one of the largest declines in FAFH; hence, the share of GDP from agriculture is larger than the global average. Other regions have a higher reduction in GDP from the FAFH shock (e.g., Argentina-recall that they had the largest decrease in FAFH expenditures, along with Mexico and India). Those that have the smallest estimated change in GDP are those that tended to have the smallest actual decline in FAFH expenditures (Australia, Other Asia, and Japan), as expected.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "Are these results plausible? The production and trade shocks are relatively small, and most regions had an increase in either or both production and trade. Thus, we would not expect large macro-economic changes resulting from production and trade alone. For FAFH, Lew (2020) notes that more than 4% of GDP is attributable to the restaurant industry in the U.S. Given that there is a 21% reduction in demand for this sector, a back-of-theenvelope (BOTE) calculation would lead to the expectation of a 0.84% decrease in GDP. The model simulates a change in GDP from the FAFH shock alone at 1.2% for the U.S. Although this is a larger estimate than the BOTE calculation, the CGE model accounts for interactions between sectors and agents. Furthermore, an argument can be made that many small businesses have been impacted by the decline in restaurant demand-potentially putting the actual decline in GDP attributable to food and agriculture at more than 1%. vii One point to be made regarding the FAFH shock is that the changes in GDP likely have more to do with lost income from labor and restaurant receipts more than it does for actual impacts on agricultural producers thus far. The decrease in FAFH does have inter-industry impacts for the demand for agricultural products, but they tend to be small (production tends to decrease less than 1%, if this scenario is conducted independently). As noted in Richards (2020) , although FAFH makes up half of food expenditures, the higher mark-ups relative to those in grocery stores mean that approximately one-third of food shipments are destined for FAFH. As noted in ERS (2020a), expenditures for food at home have increased, basically to balance out the loss in FAFH expenditures. Hence, part of the reason for the small change to primary agricultural production thus far. Back to the model estimates for economywide GDP. We note that the model does reasonably well in estimating GDP compared to actual GDP changes. The model is not able to replicate differences by regions, as is the case for all the literature estimates. On average the model tends to slightly overestimate GDP, the case for ten of the sixteen regions, but there are underestimates for China, Amel et al.

But 2020 had numerous unexpected shocks and continues to evolve as the COVID-19 virus continues to spread around the globe into 2021. For example, data indicate that farmers intended to plant 97 million acres of corn in the U.S. in 2020, up 8% from 2019, which would have been the highest corn acreage since the ethanol boom of 2012. However, demand factors, such as a reduction in the demand for ethanol (from less gasoline demand), led to the lowest USDA forecasted end-of-season price in fourteen years. As such, actual corn acreage planted was 92 million acres, the largest difference between expected and actual plantings in forty years (Abbott 2020) . But, this is still larger than 2019 plantings, and stocks are already at relatively high levels. Despite the decrease in actual acreage from expected plantings, yields are expected to be the highest in history according to WASDE, thus production is expected to still be high. Production beyond what can be used could lead to further increased stocks and lower prices in the future. However, agricultural production is uncertain and vulnerable to changes in weather and other biophysical and economic shocks. For example, the derecho storm in Iowa caused an estimated $3.77 billion in damages to agricultural production in the state that is independent from COVID-19 impacts. Although additional data can be gathered to understand the annual impacts on food and agriculture resulting from COVID-19, and estimate the impacts of agricultural shocks on GDP, it will become increasingly difficult to isolate impacts from the pandemic given other shocks to production that may occur in the future.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 767, "end": 780, "text": "(Abbott 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Potential Implications for Agriculture"}, {"text": "In terms of other agricultural sectors, Lusk, Tonsor, and Schulz (2020) note that the U.S. meat processing industry entered 2020 projected to produce record large volumes of meat, based on strong domestic and global demand. But COVID-19 caused various supply-chain disruptions. First the loss of FAFH expenditures, which usually involves higher value product; then supply-chain bottlenecks, occurring because some meat processing plants shut down, preventing animals awaiting slaughter from being processed. However, data from WASDE indicate that the impacts for the year for U.S. beef production were small overall. For hog/pork production, it has been noted (Freese 2020 ) that some of the long-term impacts from COVID-19 are the risk of hog producers going out of business; further consolidation in hog production; and fewer pigs available. It is interesting to note that prices received by agricultural producers for hogs had decreased earlier in 2020 (up to 13.6%), but prices recovered for the year (figure 4). Figure 4 presents some interesting information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on agricultural markets in 2020. The price U.S. consumers paid for food increased by 3.9% in 2020. ERS (2020a) expects food prices to increase by 2%-3% for 2021; although this ranges from a decrease in consumer beef prices of \u22122.5% to \u22121.5% to an increase in their other foods category of 3% to 4%. As noted in ERS (2020a), beef and veal prices had the highest consumer price increase of all commodities this year; but cattle producers had a 12.3% decrease in the price they receive.

An argument could be made, however, whether FAFH, could be considered as \"agricultural\" in the vein that most people think; however, this sector has a large share of their costs dedicated toward purchasing primary agricultural products and is a key source for food consumption. It should be noted that the changes to primary agricultural products and certain food processing sectors (dairy and meats) could influence agricultural markets for the next few years given the lags in production cycles attributable to agriculture.
