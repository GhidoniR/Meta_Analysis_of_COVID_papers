The outbreak was first declared as Public Health Emergency of International Concern and later as a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO) 3 . COVID-19 infection could be asymptomatic or could show mild to severe pneumonia like symptoms 4 . The most common symptoms include fever, dry cough, and tiredness, while the less common symptoms include headache, chest pain, loss of speech, difficulty in breathing, sore throat, diarrhoea, conjunctivitis or other aches and pains 5 . A noticeable feature of the disease is its highly contagious nature and, while the virus outbreak is still under investigation, there are views that the spread can happen person-to-person due to close contacts, airborne particles, and contact with contaminated surfaces 6 . Additionally, the high risk group of the COVID-19 is different from recent pandemics with the current strain particularly deadly for older individuals 7 . Thus, while the world has confronted multiple epidemics in recent times and different countries have had several preparedness plans in place following their past experiences 8 , the current pandemic has come as an unprecedented context in many countries.

For the response of this question, each respondent needed to select one of the five options (\"Very true\", \"True\", \"Neither\", \"Not true\" and \"Not at all\") against each of 21 activities. We quantify the responses innovatively in terms of three dependent variables. Notably, a recent article on the same dataset focused on the same question to characterise the Japanese citizens\" behaviour across three government recommended measures 26 . We consider the same question and items are labelled exactly as in the research dataset 26, 27 . However, our approach in assessment of pandemic protection behaviour is different. The published work examines the citizens\" behaviour and attitudes through a common umbrella of social distancing and personal etiquettes and focuses mainly on 12 items separately within the same question 26 . We, by contrast, utilise all 21 items and group these activities across three individualistic protective behaviours -\"social distancing\", \"personal protection behaviour\" and \"social responsibility behaviour\". Table 1 details the 21 activities grouped across the three dependent variables. We interpret the meaning and impacts of the respective behaviour to form the grouping. For example, stockpiling masks, medication, food, or other essential items can be interpreted as socially irresponsible behaviour especially if the general or vulnerable populace misses out on these goods. While eating nutritious diet or getting rest and exercise may be interpreted as personal behaviour, we consider the social side of the impacts of such behaviour and the need for a healthy societythus, these items are also grouped under social responsibility. Similarly, avoiding closed but ill-ventilated spaces, not J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f speaking in close proximity, avoiding mass gathering, and related practices are grouped under social distancing behaviours; while taking measures to disinfect surroundings, wearing masks, avoiding travels for any reason when having cold, and related practices are deemed as personal protection behaviours. Smoking frequency; (iii) Drinking frequency; and (iv) Trust in Government policy. The first of these attributes has a binary response (yes/no), smoking frequency has four choices (\"Every day\", \"Sometimes\", \"Used to smoke but do not now\" and \"Never smoked\"); whereas, drinking frequency offers six choices (\"Never drink\", \"I used to drink but I quitted\", \"Few times per month\", \"1-2 times per month\", \"3-6 times per month\" and \"Every day\") 25, 26 . The last one has been derived from the responses of three Government policies. They are -the Government should (a) allow mass gatherings now; (b) continue to request self-restraints of mass gatherings; and (c) limit movement in addition to mass gatherings 26 . For each policy, there are five possible responses (\"Agree\", \"Relatively agree\", \"Neither\", \"Relatively disagree\", \"Disagree\" and \"Do not know\". An aggregate of scores for the three policies reflect values of the trust in Government policy. Notably, having children, and smoking and drinking J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f frequency are related to quality of lifestyle an individual has chosen to lead, and can also in turn influence their compliance to any policies and rulesconsidering these personal attributes, hence, makes sense. Additionally, six socio-demographic variables are considered in this study. They are -(i) Age (with five choices, 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s and 60-64); (ii) Gender (female/male); (iii) Marital status (Married or Not married); (iv) Education (university/college graduate or not); (v) Work status (four choices -\"Regular employee\", \"Non-regular employee\", \"Self-employed or others\" and \"Not working\");", "cite_spans": [{"start": 252, "end": 254, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 689, "end": 691, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 782, "end": 785, "text": "26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 786, "end": 788, "text": "27", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1078, "end": 1080, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2758, "end": 2761, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2762, "end": 2764, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3023, "end": 3025, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1292, "end": 1299, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Variable quantification"}, {"text": "and (vi) Household annual income (10 ascending choices -\"less than 2,000K Japanese yen\", seven choices between 2,000K and 19,999K Japanese yen, \"More than 20,000K Japanese yen\" and \"Do not know\") 25 . As indicated in earlier sections, existing literature has focused on various demographic attributes like education, age, and gender in characterising public response to government actions during pandemics. Additionally, smoking has been noted as a risk factor of COVID-19 in multiple studies 28 , while drinking and having young children (i.e., choosing to have children) can also impact the way individuals behave in different situations.

This research reaffirms the influence sociodemographic factors and personal attributes on compliance to public policies. Interestingly, individuality and subjective behaviour have not received much attention in public health policy management and institution. In a disaster or public health emergency, governments still tend to promote some standard measures and expect everyone to follow the suggested advice. Such has also been the case in Japan. Arguably, the outcomes imply the need of targeted campaigning when governments face a pandemic or a national disaster situation. Acknowledging that not everyone is likely to have the same level of trust and subjective beliefs moderated by socio-demographic and personal attributes are likely to influence individuals\" compliances to any public policy, governments, rather than just instituting common public measures, may also focus on identifying demographic groups at high risk of non-compliance and adopt various social marketing strategies for effective policy outcomes. Future research can provide more insights in this regard.

Fern\u00e1ndez-Delgado et al 57 claimed RF as the best classifier among the many machine learning approaches. A later work, however, has refuted this claim by identifying weaknesses in the previous study 58 . Another recent research compared CART and RF and noted CART as a better performing approach for data with different conditions including when there are missing information 33 . Considering these, we focus on CART in our research. The choice is also due to the easy interpretability of CART outcomes. In this context, it may be argued that structural equation modelling (SEM) can also lead to similar hierarchical explanation of relationships in data. However, as noted by Medina-Borja and Pasupathy 59 , CART is applicable when the aim is to extract knowledge from data as compared to SEM which can support or contradict any predetermined linear interrelationship between variables. With our focus on identifying influential variables, the use of CART is hence justified. Further, as also outlined earlier, CART can conceptualise non-parametric and nonlinear relationship among data 60 , and can therefore avoid limitations in a linear regression.
