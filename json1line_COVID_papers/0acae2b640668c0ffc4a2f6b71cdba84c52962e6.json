This study included a single hospitals' ED experience and may limit the generalisability of the results to other healthcare organisations. However, the aim of this study was to explore a recent MHR implementation in the ED, so the lack of broad generalisability is unlikley a major concern. In addition, our interviews were restricted to 30 min in duration and held via video conference. Face-to-face interviews may have facilitated a longer format [45] , and thus more in-depth insights. However, our study took place during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic, therefore video conferencing supported a time efficient and viable alternative. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic had implications on the Australian healthcare workforce, likely impacting staff at Cabrini Health and participants in this research [46] . For example, pressure to rebalance resources, changes in the number of inperson visits (including ED presentations) and changes to staff availability (due to exposure to COVID-19 and mental health challenges) may have reduced the number of available participants [46] . Despite the pandemic, the response rate to surveys and interviews was over 44%, a higher response rate than comparable studies with ED clinicians by Winden et al. [25] and Partridge, Affleck [47] , (response rates of 28.9% and 37%, respectively). Moreover, saturation was reached in the qualitative interviews, therefore the impact of COVID-19 on the study's outcomes was most likely minimal. Future at-scale research that explores the association between MHR use, efficiencies and patient outcomes in the ED is required.
