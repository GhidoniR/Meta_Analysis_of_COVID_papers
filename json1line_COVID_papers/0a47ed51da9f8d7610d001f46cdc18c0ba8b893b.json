Practical disadvantages associated with the currently used live-parasite vaccine could be overcome by subunit vaccines. An 80-aa polypeptide derived from the C-terminal portion of p67, a sporozoite surface Ag and target of neutralizing Abs, was the focus of the efforts on subunit vaccines against ECF and subjected to several vaccine trials with very promising results. However, the vaccination regimen was far from optimized, involving three inoculations of 450 mg of soluble p67C (s-p67C) Ag formulated in the Seppic adjuvant Montanide ISA 206 VG. Hence, an improved formulation of this polypeptide Ag is needed. In this study, we report on two nanotechnologies that enhance the bovine immune responses to p67C. Individually, HBcAg-p67C (chimeric hepatitis B core Ag virus-like particles displaying p67C) and silica vesicle (SV)-p67C (s-p67C adsorbed to SV-140-C 18 , octadecylmodified SVs) adjuvanted with ISA 206 VG primed strong Ab and T cell responses to p67C in cattle, respectively. Coimmunization of cattle (Bos taurus) with HBcAg-p67C and SV-p67C resulted in stimulation of both high Ab titers and CD4 T cell response to p67C, leading to the highest subunit vaccine efficacy we have achieved to date with the p67C immunogen.

Conceptually, SV nanoparticles offer a simpler technology as overnight incubation with an Ag results in its adsorption to the SVs and generation of particulate Ag, albeit in a different format to that by VLPs (23, 34) . Altering the surface chemistry of SV-140 to create a hydrophobic surface property by adding -C 18 functional groups to them resulted in optimal adsorption of s-p67C. In contrast, in a study with the E2 Ag of BVDV-1, the nonfunctionalized SVs gave the highest level of Ag adsorption (23) , pointing out there is not a gold-standard SV and, therefore, specific Ags must be tested with a variety of SVs to find the optimal nanoparticle. Assessment of Ag-specific Ab and CD4 + T cell responses has been informative on the performance of the individual VLP and SV Ag delivery systems and their intrinsic properties in stimulating different arms of the immune response. HBcAg-p67C VLPs with a T = 4 symmetry are predicted to contain 120 dimeric subunits and should display 240 copies of p67C (42) . It is reasonable to speculate that the display of p67C at high-density and in a regular array on the VLPs results in improved cross-linking of surface Ig and B cell activation (12, 42, 43) , resulting in the high p67C Ab response that included a switch to an IgG2 subtype. Unlike in other species, there is no clear evidence for a major difference in the functional role of bovine IgG1 and IgG2. Both subtypes can fix complement, although there are some differences in their opsonizing capacity with superior performance associated with IgG2 (44) . Bovine allotypic variants of IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 have been described (45) (46) (47) (48) , but reagents to assay them are not available. Thus, little is known about their functional importance. Interestingly enough, the high Ab responses were not in agreement with the CD4 + T cell responses in this group of animals, as the cellular responses were directed mainly to the HBcAg polypeptide sequences.

Priming of an Ab response could occur by direct interaction of B cells with p67C at the surface of the SV or via interaction with soluble Ag that is released from the particles. However, the former, if it occurs, does not promote an Ab switch and the latter may contribute to the delayed peak of the Ab response to the last SV-p67C Ag boost at day 91 instead of day 77, as seen with HBcAg-p67C and s-p67C. Ag bound to the internal surfaces is likely to be protected from degradation and the subsequent endocytosis of the SV-p67C into professional APCs, may facilitate intact p67C entering the MHC class II Ag-processing and presentation pathway via the endosomal system (51) , resulting in the strong CD4 + T cell response detected in this study. Indeed, using confocal fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrated that the SV-p67C-FITC preparations can be trafficked into an acidic compartment of cells in in vitro experiments.

But the inclusion of the adjuvant ISA 206 VG stimulated a balanced immune response, indicating that the possible enhancing effect of the SVs, is further potentiated by this adjuvant. The capacity of SVs to enhance the immune response may be related to whether the adsorbed Ag is a good or poor immunogen (e.g., the E2 Ag of BVDV-1 and s-p67C polypeptide, respectively). However, it is likely that other factors influenced the outcome. The interaction between the different Ags with the SV nanoparticles may play a critical role, affecting the release properties of the adsorbed Ag from the SV after cellular uptake. Based on this hypothesis, the p67C molecules may be strongly adsorbed to the SV-140-C 18 particles and the adjuvant ISA 206 VG could act to increase the cell uptake, making both mechanisms indispensable for successfully eliciting an immune response.

Hence, we immunized 15 cattle with three doses of HBcAg-p67C and SV-p67C (equivalent of 140-150 mg of s-p67C per dose) formulated separately. As expected from the immunogenicity studies, the two nanoparticle systems stimulated both p67C-specific Ab and CD4 + T cell responses in all 15 cattle, corroborating not only that the two delivery systems did not compete, but they acted synergistically to generate balanced immune responses. This is in line with a previous study in mice, which used Ad5/MERS and boosted with spike protein nanoparticles and they found that balanced Ab and cell-mediated responses were generated (56) . Importantly, in the current study, upon challenge, \u223c53% of the cattle were immune to an approximately LD 93 sporozoite challenge, which is the highest challenge dose used to test p67C protective capacity and using more than three times less p67C Ag to date (7, 10, 11) . ECF is a dose-dependent disease and the animals in the challenge experiment got double the amount of sporozoites compared with any of the previous published experiments (7, 10, 11) , the immune response generated specifically against p67C had to fight a significantly higher parasite load to get 53% of the animals protected. Moreover, the outcome of the challenge experiment allowed an assessment of the association between the Ab titers and the CD4 indices with protection. The association of both parameters with protection individually was NS. However, when the two parameters were taken in combination, the association was significant with an observed level of immunity of 100%, indicating that both immune parameters are associated with protection against ECF. However, further investigations are needed to assess the individual associations of the immune parameters with protection. This is a work in progress and a priority in ECF research. The findings reported in this study support the combined use of VLPs and SV technology as a novel vaccination strategy to enhance the immunogenicity of otherwise poor Ags in large animal vaccine studies. In the current study, the nanoparticle platforms acted synergistically for enhanced efficacy against a complex parasite like T. parva. The simplicity of SVs to adsorb and deliver an Ag without measurable adverse reactions, combined with low manufacturing cost, make them a very attractive platform for Ag delivery. These results also demonstrate the huge potential of the use of VLPs for the future development of improved vaccines against ECF. The immune responses could be further improved to achieve a higher vaccine efficacy with two doses of Ag or the inclusion of other sequences from p67 that contain additional sporozoite-neutralizing sites (9, 10).
