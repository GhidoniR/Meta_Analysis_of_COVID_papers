[3] According to the ratio nature, the high proportion of positivity is due to the high number of positive tests or the low number of total tests. Based on the first possibility, a higher positivity rate suggests higher transmission and that there are likely more people with coronavirus in the community who have not been tested yet. On the other hand, according to the second possibility, a high percentage of positivity means that more testing should probably be done. Accordingly, for policymakers, the high value for this parameter suggests either it is not a good time to relax restrictions aimed at reducing transmission, or it is a good time to add restrictions to slow the spread of disease [3] .

Finally, to illustrate the dependency of the number of tests and the positivity rates, we apply copulas. Sklar introduced the concept of copulas in 1959 [5] . A copula -mainly parametric, partially semi-parametric, and rarely non-parametric-is a function that completely describes the dependency structure. It contains all the information to link the marginal distributions to their joint distribution. Accordingly, to obtain a valid multivariate distribution function, it suffices to combine several marginal distribution functions with any candidate for the copula function. Thus, for the .

Table 1 includes the key general indicators up to January 25, 2021. It is worth saying that the total indicators or even per-million indicators do not determine the quality of health care systems because there are observable underreported statistics about the countries Bolivia, Guatemala, Nigeria, Iran, and even India. Despite the mentioned reality, we consider the indicator of the number of tests per one million (the 7 th column of Table 1 ) as a criterion representing the level of facilities, therefore the quality of health care systems. Based on the information about this criterion, we define the lags (the distance between the test and diagnosis) for the different health care systems. Table 2 represents the underlying properties of any country. As mentioned before, lag is the difference between the time of testing and the time of receiving the results of the tests, positive or negative, in days. The more facilities a health care system has, the more tests that system can do -therefore the lower positivity rate it has. Also, the more facilities a health care system has, the lower distance is between the tests and results. Based on the concept of lag, we pair the number of tests on the th day with the number of results on the ( + ) th day to obtain the dependency structure by using the copulas.

Generally, during an epidemic wave, the number of new infected individuals increases rapidly to an epidemic peak and then falls more gradually until the epidemic wave is over, and the number of new cases be stabilized.

In addition, it is noticeable that the distance between two successive epidemic peaks must be at least one month. This definition is derived from the definition of outlier in regression analysis. According to this definition, the peaks of Table 3 are obtained for the countries of interest. It is remarkable that except for the peaks of Bolivia -which are almost the same-, the later waves are more acute than previous ones. We must add this point that the more acute peak means the more number of new confirmed cases, therefore the more intense spreading. Finally, it is possible that because of the lack of information at the beginning, this definition misses the epidemic peaks in the initial days. Mathematically and logically, the number of positive tests (confirmed cases) is affected by the number of tests and positivity rate. The number of cases equals the number of tests multiplied by the positivity rate.

Table 3 shows that the proportion of positivity is significantly better than the frequency of tests to indicate the peaks of the pandemic. The positivity rate is more associated with the number of cases than the number of tests (90% versus 45%). After moving average, these proportions reach 100% and 50%, respectively.

Figure 5 is the plot of the joint distribution of the number of tests on a day and the proportion of positivity on the days later. Figure 1 shows that the peaks of the number of tests coincide with the epidemic peaks of COVID-19 in different countries. For example, in the USA, there are two peaks of the number of tests simultaneous with the second and the third epidemic peaks -mentioned in Table 3 -. Also, it is obvious that Bolivia has experienced two peaks for the number of tests around 150 th and 300 th days -from March 19, 2020which coincide with the epidemic peaks in Table 3 . The USA, the UK, and the UAE experienced some regularly rising time series. Except for some overruns in epidemic peaks, the patterns of Italy and South Africa are increasing too. The number of tests in Guatemala is increasing, accompanied by an increasing fluctuation. Owing to the restriction by the limited capacity of tests, Iran and Nigeria followed a stepwise trend. Apart from the peaks, one for each of them, the plots of Australia and South Korea are stationary. In the case of Bolivia, the time series is proportional to the peaks. India is the only country whose time series is initially increasing, then stable, and after that decreasing. Generally, the counties have an increasing trend.

It is worthwhile that the graph of Iran has three peaks while the first of them is missed in Table 3 because of the lack of information at the beginning. A similar situation (being missed by investigation of either the number of tests or the number of confirmed cases while discovered by the analysis of the positivity rate) happens to the epidemic peak in India in late March, the first and the second peaks of the UK, and the epidemic peaks in middle May and the November for the UAE.

If the reason for an increase be the rising number of tests, we expect not to return the previous channel in short term. In addition, the positivity rate does not undertake a remarkable change. On the other hand, it is normal to assume that entering a peak is accompanied by increasing the number of negative tests as well. Consequently, the lack of the growth of negative test results (rising the positivity rate while continuing the previous trend for the frequency of tests) is only reasonable if at least one of the factors of tests accuracy, testing policy, or the viewpoint of the population were changed around that time. Otherwise, there are a remarkable number of un-reported cases belonging the peak. It is noticeable that this company of risings causes the observed acceleration in growth regarding epidemic peaks. .

The crucial step in the modeling process is the choice of the copula function, which best fits the data. Further work is needed to choose the best copulas able to reproduce the dependence structure of bivariate medical variables. In clinical trials or medical studies, sample size is often an important consideration and is relatively small.
