Previous research has focused on the manifestation of psychological wellbeing through anxiety and depression, rather than positive definitions and protective factors. That is, existing studies in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic examine only the absence of illness instead of the presence of wellness. Thus, research has overlooked human capacity, factors that contribute to our thriving, and protective elements associated with well-being (Ryff and Singer, 1996; Ryff, 2014) . Ryff and Singer (1996) proposed that positive psychological well-being contains multiple dimensions, including selfacceptance, positive relations with others, autonomy, environmental mastery, purpose in life, and personal growth. The 6-dimension conceptualization of psychological well-being has been utilized as a comprehensive indicator of psychological functioning and life outcomes in various studies [for a review, see Ryff (2014) ]. The integration of mental health and life-span development theories points to the converging aspects of positive psychological functioning (Ryff and Singer, 1996) .

Environmental mastery refers to the ability to manage the environment, choosing or creating contexts that are congruent with personal needs and values. The facet of personal growth measures the extent to which an individual feels that they are engaging in continued development. Positive relations refers to the perception that one has warm and trusting interpersonal relationships. Next, purpose in life refers to being goal-driven or being guided by a sense of direction in life. The final facet, self-acceptance, is defined as having a positive attitude toward the self. This involves having self-acceptance and positive feelings about past experiences (Ryff and Keyes, 1995) . Each facet was measured by three items. Respondents rated how strongly they agreed or disagreed with corresponding statements using a 7-point scale, in which 1 indicated \"strongly agree\" and 7 indicated \"strongly disagree.\" Item responses were reverse-coded so that greater scores indicated greater psychological well-being.

Overall, the psychological well-being of the students was high. Among the six subscales of psychological well-being, the highest score was personal growth (14.2), followed by positive relations with others (13.9), environmental mastery (13.8), purpose of life (13.5), autonomy (12.9), and self-acceptance (12.7). The average resilience score was 68.6 with a SD of 13.4. and a range of 14-98. The average COVID-19 confirmed cases in students' provinces was 14,264 (SD = 26,894), ranging from 157 to 68,139. The large range and high standard deviation of this variable together suggest that students resided in provinces with quite different levels of COVID-19 cases. The variance of COVID-19 cases at the province level allows us to examine whether local COVID-19 infection rates affected students' psychological well-being during the pandemic. Table 1 also presents the descriptive statistics of individual socio-demographic characteristics. Majority of the sample was female, mirroring the social science student population in China. The mean age of the sample was 20.6 (SD = 1.0). Over half of the students (52.4%) had city household registration (HR), followed by 38.7% with rural HR, and 8.9% with city but prior rural HR. Majority of students reported that their parents were married (89.0%). The average family income was 90,990 RMB (about 13,580 USD) in the past year, with a standard deviation of 122,030 RMB (18,170 USD). About 25% of students reported that their families received at least one form of social welfare, such as low-income assistance, food subsidies, and other subsidies, in the past year. Table 2 presents the OLS regression standardized estimates of psychological well-being. Given the wide range of COVID-19 cases by province, the variable was first transformed into a natural log number, then entered into regression analyses. The results indicated that resilience and HR had significant effects on Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org psychological well-being. Increasing one standard deviation of resilience led to a 0.51-SD increase in psychological well-being. The finding supports our first hypothesis. Compared to students with rural HR, students with city HR had greater psychological well-being (\u00df = 0.06). Province-level COVID-19 cases and family income also showed marginal effects on the psychological wellbeing. A one-SD increase in family income was associated with a 0.03-SD increase in psychological well-being, while the estimated effect of COVID-19 cases on psychological well-being was \u22120.03. This finding marginally supports our second hypothesis. It is evident that resilience had a large effect on the degree of psychological well-being among the students, while HR, family income, and the number of COVID-19 cases had modest effects on their well-being. We conducted robustness tests on the six subscales of psychological well-being. The regression analyses were conducted similarly to the analysis that produced the results of Table 2 , but the dependent variable was replaced by each of the six subscales of the psychological well-being measure. The results are presented in Table 3 . For simplicity, we only present the standardized estimates of our key variables, resilience and number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in this table. The results for other variables have been made available in the supplementary materials. Resilience shows significant and positive effects on all six subscales, while confirmed COVID-19 cases shows significant negative effects on personal growth and marginally negative effects on purpose of life.

A longitudinal study design may better approximate such relations. Next, this study is subject to omitted variable bias, considering that unobserved variables (e.g., peer support and academic stressors) may have affected psychological well-being within the student sample. Third, we used measurements that relied on self-reporting to assess for resilience and psychological well-being. Issues with self-reporting include both unintended and intended reporting errors. For example, in the case of social desirability bias, students may be compelled to overreport their psychological well-being due to stigma related to poor mental health. To address this, future studies can use data triangulation by gathering information from peer and teacher reports to verify the findings of this study. Additionally, although the study sample size and diversity of colleges from which we drew our sample increase our confidence in the results, the generalizability of these findings to the larger college population in China is unknown and requires further research.
