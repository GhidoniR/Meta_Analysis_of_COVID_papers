To address this, we developed a Luminex-based multiplex immunoassay that detects total antibodies (IgG/IgM/IgA) against the N, S1 and RBD antigens and used it to compare antibody responses in 1225 blood donors across Greece.

The clinical performance of the developed multiplex assay was evaluated in 155 serum samples from 77 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 78 pre-pandemic individuals ( Table 1) . The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were calculated for the three single antigen readouts and for 11 multi-antigen consensus-based rules for detection of total, IgG, IgA and IgM isotypes. Performance was evaluated using a cut-off value of mean plus three standard deviation (SD) for each antigen and the results are presented in Table 2 . When assessed individually, antigens (RBD, N and S1) were equally specific producing one or two false positives out of the 78 negative samples tested [specificity 97.4% (95% CI 91.1-99.3%) to 98.7% (95% CI 92.7-99.8%)]. Rules-based approaches, requiring at least two of the antigens to be above the cut-off (i.e. rules using an AND gate between two antigens) for reporting a positive result, improved assay specificity in all isotypes vs. individual antigens ( Table 2) . On the other hand, rules, requiring at least one/ any of the antigens to be above the cut-off (i.e. OR-based rules), did not improve assay performance when compared to the best performing individual antigen for the respective antibody isotype. Overall, rules that utilized all three antigens and set a positive result when at least two of them were above the cut-off (Antigen A AND [B OR C] reported as A&B|C) showed improved performance, which was further investigated in terms of its statistical significance. On this front, the power of the statistical tests, comparing the sensitivity and specificity between the single-antigen (RBD, N and S1) and multi-antigen rules for the detection of total antibody, was calculated and is presented in Table 3 . In the comparison of specificity, the calculated power (0.816) indicates that there is a high chance that the observed improvement in specificity of the multi-antigen rules is correctly classified as statistically significant (Table 3) . On the other hand, the power calculation shows that no statistically significant differences can be identified between the sensitivities of the single-antigen tests and multi-antigen rules, given the sample size of 77 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases.

Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were calculated for gradually increasing threshold (cut-off) values, based on the negative sample distribution of each antigen and antibody isotype and are presented in Fig. 1 . Rules using all antigens and requiring two or all three to be higher than the threshold were included in the analysis. Across all isotypes, rules exhibited a more robust profile and were less affected by changes in the cut-off thresholds compared to individual antigens. Rules provided a clear benefit in assay specificity with specificities of 100% (95% CI 95.3-100%) achieved at much lower cut-offs compared to individual antigens. Additionally, for total and IgG antibody detection, assay sensitivity was retained at high levels across a wide range of cut-offs resulting in an overall more robust and accurate assay. The statistical significance of the robustness in sensitivity and specificity of the single-antigen assays and multi-antigen rules was evaluated using the McNemar's test. The McNemar's test was applied on each assay to test for differences in specificity and sensitivity when different cut-off values, based on the distribution of negative samples, are considered.

Therefore, we used the in-house total (IgG/IgA/IgM) SARS-CoV-2 antibody multiplex assay to assess how its high clinical performance translates to estimating seroprevalence in 1225 blood donors with no known history of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Seroprevalence was calculated based on the single antigen readouts and the RBD & N|S1, RBD|N|S1 multi-antigen rules and was found to be strongly influenced both by the antigen analyzed and the cut-off value used to determine the diagnostic outcome (Fig. 3A) . As it can be seen in Fig. 3A , seroprevalence rates from single antigen readouts ranged between 0.8% (N, mean plus 5 SD cut-off, 95% CI 0.4-1.5%) and 7.5% (S1, mean plus 3 SD cut-off, 95% CI 6.0-8.9%), indicating a wide range of potentially indeterminate cases. When using the RBD&N|S1 rule, seroprevalence ranged between 0.6% (mean plus 5 SD cut-off for each antigen, 95% CI 0.3-1.1%) and 1.2% (mean plus 3 SD cut-off, 95% CI 0.7-2.0%), exhibiting a robust profile in line with its robust performance in the clinical setting. Furthermore, we examined the overlap of positive individuals being diagnosed by our single antigens or the RBD&N|S1 rule using the stringent cut-off of mean plus 5 SD (Fig. 3B ). We observed a strikingly low agreement between antigens, in www.nature.com/scientificreports/ that different antigens resulted in vastly different subsets of positive individuals. Specifically, N shared 2 positive samples with RBD (5.9% agreement) and 1 with S1 (1.8% agreement), while S1 and RBD shared 6 positive samples (9.1% agreement). The RBD&N|S1 rule had a total of 7 positive calls, 5 of which were samples with S1 and RBD positive readouts, 1 with RBD and N positive readouts and 1 with all three antigens above the cut-off. The statistical significance of the disagreement between the results of the single antigen readouts and multiantigen rules was examined using the McNemar's test and the resulting p-values are presented in Table 5 . As it can be seen in Table 5 , the striking disagreement between the tests is highly significant, with the only exception being the comparison between the single readout against N and the RBD & N|S1 rule (p-value of 0.4). Finally, we re-analyzed all 1225 samples with an independent commercially available test which detects IgG N-specific antibodies (Abbott).

More than 300 assays have been developed using either the N, S1 or RBD antigens and many of them have already reached the market in unforeseen development speeds 4 . However, it is questionable whether single-antigen assays, with strong clinical performance characteristics, show sufficient diagnostic performance in population screening studies 5 . Here, we developed single and multi-antigen assays, evaluated their performance in clinical samples and investigated how the increased performance of multi-antigen assays translates to seroprevalence estimation in a population study. The developed multiplex platform enabled the simultaneous detection of diverse antibody responses against N, S1 and RBD, within a single diagnostic run. In line with other clinical performance reports, we found a high variability of IgM and IgA responses to different antigens in 77 previously infected SARS-CoV-2 individuals ( Supplementary Fig. S3) 14 . In contrast, nearly all positive individuals produced IgG specific antibodies against all three antigens. Other studies have also evaluated N, S1, and RBD antigens in single or multiplex formats and reported similar performance characteristics in samples tested 2 to 3 weeks post infection 6, [15] [16] [17] . The validation of our single-antigen assays against commercial single-antigen tests (Abbott-N and Euroimmun-S1) showed 100% agreement with our N and S1 readouts (Fig. 2) . However, diagnostic outcomes between commercial tests and the RBD&N|S1 rule were slightly different, suggesting that previously infected SARS-CoV-2 individuals may be misdiagnosed by single antigen-based tests (Fig. 2B) . In support, the absence of antibodies against certain SARS-CoV-2 antigens is also apparent in studies that have compared assays targeting different antigens 6, [17] [18] [19] ; yet, the biological basis of these observations is currently not well understood.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1127, "end": 1129, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1422, "end": 1424, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1425, "end": 1429, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1430, "end": 1434, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1435, "end": 1439, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1993, "end": 1995, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1996, "end": 2000, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2001, "end": 2005, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2006, "end": 2010, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1104, "end": 1126, "text": "Supplementary Fig. S3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1603, "end": 1611, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1824, "end": 1833, "text": "(Fig. 2B)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The rules-based approach combines single antigen readouts, using \"AND\" and \"OR\" logic rules, in order to further enhance the specificity, accuracy and robustness of the multi-antigen assay. Such approaches have already been shown to enhance the diagnostic performance of serological assays for common SARS-CoV and for SARS-CoV-2 9 . In our study, we showed that an optimally selected combination of AND plus OR rules can increase specificity and accuracy, with little or no cost on sensitivity, for IgG and total antibody detection in clinical samples (Tables 2, 3) . After testing all potential rule combinations the optimal rule was identified as the RBD&N|S1 ( Table 2 ). The optimal rule utilized the best performing readout (RBD antigen) whose specificity was further enhanced by requiring consensus (AND) with either S1, N, or both readouts (Table 3) . By using the readout against the RBD antigen as basis, the RBD & N|S1 rule has the added benefit of potentially informing on the presence of neutralizing antibodies as well 11, 20 . Additionally, by utilizing the readout against N, the rule can decrease the effects of potential antibody cross-reactivity that exists against the S proteins that are conserved between coronaviruses. Finally, since Spike-based vaccines have shown tremendous efficacy and have received regulatory approval, multiplexing with N has the potential to act as a distinguishing factor between vaccination-induced or natural immunity. Most importantly, the rules-based approach significantly improved Table 5 . p-values of the McNemar's test to compare the agreement in positive/negative calls between rules for total antibody detection in the seroprevalence study. The cut-off of Mean + 5SD is used for each single and multi-antigen test. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ assay robustness (i.e. how small deviations of the cut off value affect the diagnostic outcome). The RBD&N|S1 rule resulted in an assay with a statistically significant robust performance profile across a wide range of cut-off values, compared to single-antigen assays, suggesting that this multi-antigen combinatorial assay can achieve optimal performance at lower cut-offs (Fig. 1, Table 4 ). It is worth noting that while multi-antigen rules exhibited improved performance in IgG and total antibody detection, they did not improve the performance of the IgA and IgM assays (Table 2 ). However, for the seroprevalence study, we decided to utilize the total (IgG/IgA/ IgM) detection assay, in order to correctly identify recently infected individuals who have not yet developed IgG antibodies against the virus. The use and application of our multiplex strategy in 1255 samples from randomly selected blood donors aims to provide a dataset of experimental settings that mimic routine low-prevalence screening. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a multi-antigen serological assay was applied to a seroprevalence study. In contrast to clinical samples, where almost all positive donors showed high antibody titers for all three antigens, a substantial number of donors revealed different responses against the N, S1 and RBD antigens and only one of the 1225 donors showed high antibody titers against all three antigens. With such high dissensus between single-antigen responses, it is obvious that diagnosis of seroconversion in the population becomes challenging ( Table 5 ). Even the highly concordant S1 and RBD antigens, which exhibited an almost perfect agreement in the clinical study, showed only a 9% agreement in the population study (6 out of 66 positive calls) (Fig. 3B) . One explanation for this disagreement is that SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals in population-wide screens are mostly asymptomatic, with low antibody titers and unknown time since infection, during which antibodies to specific epitopes may have already waned below the detection limit [22] [23] [24] . Another important reason for this large disagreement is the imperfect specificity of single-antigen assays, which can lead to a large number of false predictions in a population screening 5 . For example, assuming 1% seroprevalence and 100% sensitivity, the maximum observed 97.4% single-antigen specificity in the clinical performance study would result in ~ 31 false positive predictions in the serosurvey, whereas just 12 samples are expected to be truly positive 25 . Based on this, we believe that the estimated 7.5% seroprevalence, which was observed in Fig. 3A at mean plus 3 SD with S1, may include mostly false positive predictions. The striking differences in the seroconversion calls between antigens were reflected not only in the wide range of estimated seroprevalence rates (0.6-7.5%) but more importantly in the vastly different subsets of potentially SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals (Fig. 3B ). Consistent to our findings, a side-by-side comparison of three fully automated SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays (Abbott against N, Roche against N, and DiaSorin against S1/S2 antigens) showed good agreement in 65 samples from COVID-19 patients, but had profound discrepancies in positive predictions at 1% seroprevalence 26 . Likewise, in an epidemiological study in Iceland, out of the 18,609 individuals tested for total anti-N and anti-S1-RBD antibodies using independent commercial kits, 158 were found positive for either N or S1-RBD but only 39 of them had antibodies against both epitopes 27 .

To achieve the most accurate estimate of seroprevalence, an ideal 100% specific assay is required. One approach to increase specificity involves raising the cut-off value of the assay, an approach that IVD manufacturers prefer to adopt to be on the safe side regarding positive predictions. However, raising the cut-off value of single-antigen approaches can lead to a profound underestimation of the seroprevalence rate (as shown in Fig. 3A) . A better approach for accurate seroprevalence estimation would be confirmatory testing with an independent assay that uses a different antigenic target 29 . In this paper, we showed that the specificity of the multi-antigen assay can be increased by using a consensus-based strategy, rather than increasing the cut-off value ( Table 2) . On this front, our rules-based method achieved an almost consistent seroprevalence rate in a wide range of cut-off values between 3 and 5 standard deviations above the mean (Fig. 3A , Table 4 ). Consequently, we believe that the RBD&N|S1 rule combined with a mean plus 5 SD threshold provides a realistic estimation of seroprevalence in the community and accurate identification of seroconverted individuals. Notably, in our study we used cut-off thresholds between 3 and 5 SDs whereas the manufacturer's recommended 1.4 cut-off value for the IgG N-specific Abbott test was calculated to correspond to more than 10 SDs above the negative mean. Such high cut-off values can undermine sensitivity and result in the underestimation of the true seroprevalence rate. When using the rules-based multiplex assay (RBD&N|S1) as reference the positive predictive value of the IgG N-specific Abbot test was only 29% (2 out of 7 detected), despite both assays showing excellent agreement in clinical samples (Supplementary Fig. S7 ). An important limitation of such comparisons between serological assays in population-wide surveys is the fact that there is no gold standard method to identify individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 759, "end": 761, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 596, "end": 604, "text": "Fig. 3A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 934, "end": 942, "text": "Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 1118, "end": 1126, "text": "(Fig. 3A", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1129, "end": 1136, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF4"}, {"start": 1941, "end": 1963, "text": "(Supplementary Fig. S7", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Whilst offering improvements in diagnostic performance and population-wide studies, multi-antigen based serological assays do come with some limitations. Assuming that antibodies to different antigens have different decay rates, the consensus-based rules have the potential caveat of misdiagnosing positive individuals, whose antibody responses to two out of three antigens have waned below detection levels and subsequently underestimate the seroprevalence rate in the population. Additionally, population's exposure to the virus, if based solely on antibody tests (both multi-and single-antigen), can be underestimated since asymptomatic infection could cause T cell immunity without detectable seroconversion. Finally, multiplex technologies are not as accessible as their more traditional single ELISA counterparts which makes them a less popular choice especially among countries with preexisting economic challenges during a rapid onset, global pandemic.
