While most of these pathogens have been either eradicated or have a cure developed, as globalization increases, new emergent diseases remain an increasing global threat. Ebola virus, hantavirus, zika virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and coronaviruses are some of the viral families that have been identified and have continuously posed a threat in the past decades [2, 3] . Currently, we are amidst a pandemic caused by a member of the coronavirus family, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) which has claimed 1.7 million lives and significantly impacted the global economy. The pharmaceutical research in response has been relentless and fruitful, however as seen during the ongoing pandemic, despite recent technology breakthroughs, development and widescale production of vaccines take well over a year.

The N-terminal S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 has a high affinity to the membrane bound human Angiotensin-II Converting Enzyme (ACE2) protein allowing the virus to adhere to the cell surface exposing the S protein to host proteases to initiate infection. This mechanism is shared by several known human pathogenic coronavirus [6] [7] [8] [9] . Furthermore, the S1 sub-unit has high genetic variability among coronaviruses, allowing these viruses to cross-species and thereby highlighting the threat of coronavirus in the future [7, 10] . The binding affinity of viral S protein to ACE2 implicates ACE2 as a drug target against SARS-CoV-2.

Furthermore, it also shows peptidase activity against bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin, playing a crucial role in the regulation of several hormonal pathways [12] . Specifically, ACE2 belongs to Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) where Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme (ACE or ACE1) converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor which in turn is converted into angiotensin (1-7) by ACE2. This system is tightly regulated through orchestration from liver, lungs, kidneys, and renal gland [13] . Thus, it is of the outmost importance to be able to avoid the viral infection while preserving the biological function of this enzyme. To achieve this task, the ACE2:S1 binding interface or the S1 fragment would represent suitable targets. However, protein-protein interaction surfaces are largely featureless, with no direct clefts or pockets amendable to small-molecule recognition. Furthermore, examination of the S1 surface involved in ACE2 binding demonstrates this problem for Spike. The S1 surface is featureless, relatively structurally smooth with no obvious pockets or clefts for small molecules to bind to with high affinity.

This causes a distortion of the ACE2:S1 binding interface [15] . Moreover, ligand binding studies have identified a closing motion associated with ligand binding, suggesting that the closed conformation represents the catalytically active state of the enzyme [16] . These structural insights imply ACE2 as a viable target to block S1 recognition through allosteric control of open-closed transitions necessary for S1 recognition. Indeed, several groups have performed computational drug screens on libraries of approved molecules for potential therapeutic targets and rapid deployment by targeting ACE2 as well as proteases that initiates membrane fusion [17, 18] . We note that the previous computational drug screens of the ACE2-Spike complex focused on limited size data-sets, considered only a single ACE2 structure, and were limited to the ACE2-Spike interface [19, 20] .

Specifically, with this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of such protocol, both in terms of accuracy and speed, by identifying existing FDA approved drugs that may treat CoVID-19 and possible mechanisms of action, including allosteric inhibition. These strategies can be leveraged to expand to databases on the scale of millions of compounds, lending the approach amendable to the development of de novo treatments. To demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, we first screen a library of approved drugs from DrugBank and ZINC using a fast and accurate machine learning approach termed SSnet to identify compounds predicted to have high-binding affinities [29] . These hits are cross-validated against traditional drug docking algorithm smina using the Autodock Vina scoring function [30] . The SSnet approach is then extended to a library of 750,000 in BindingDB, to discard compounds that are predicted to have a poor capacity for binding. The truncated library can then be assayed using alternative drug docking approaches and subsequent analysis using molecular dynamics, as well as in vitro assays, to identify possible targeted therapeutics ( Figure 2 ).

The optimal conformation for protein-protein binding can be both induced or inhibited by drug binding. While competitive binding of ligands at the protein-protein interaction interface can directly inhibit the interaction, ligand binding in allosteric sites can stabilize conformations that inhibit or enhance the protein-protein interaction Yan et al. [14] . observed that the viral S1 fragment could only be co-crystallized with ACE2 in the closed ACE2 conformation. In contrast, in the absence of S1 fragment, ACE2 crystallized in both open and closed conformation [14] . Their results indicate that the allosteric control of ACE2 conformational dynamics may enable a robust way to block ACE2:S1 recognition and subsequent SARS-COV-2 infection. Since SSnet predicts the same binding affinities and binding regions regardless of the protein conformation, when multiple structures of a protein are available, SSnet is able to predict ligand binding using a single conformation. Further, PLI prediction can be performed for both ACE2 and ACE2:S1 to investigate selectivity. This approach allows us to propose a hypothesis for PLI mechanism. Herein, we propose four scenarios for ACE2-S1-ligand interaction, summarized in bullets below and shown in Figure 5 . Previous validation of SSnet indicated the method was robust in identifying both allosteric regulators, and ligands that bind to hidden conformations. In this regard, it is well-suited to identify potential regulators for case I-IV. Further, our rapid method can be implemented to screen large drug libraries against all three structures and together with secondary screening in smina, can be used to select for molecules that potentially fall into the favorable Case-III and Case-IV scenarios. The mechanisms of drug action proposed cannot be validated using drug docking and scoring methods alone and will require methods that apply higher levels of theory like molecular dynamics or experimental verification. However, we can still screen for Case-III as the drugs that present a high score for the open conformation but low for the complex might lead to the stabilization of the open conformation and thereby disrupt spike recognition. The case-III would apply for both interface binding ligands as well as ligands that bind to the catalytic pocket or peripheral sites not examined in previous CoVID-19 computational screens. Using these criteria, Table S3 was generated to seek drugs that may selectively bind to ACE2 to negate interactions with S1 via allosteric disruption of ACE2. In addition to the scenarios just presented, the virus could be prevented from binding ACE2 by drug molecules that bind to the surface of the peptidase domain of ACE2, which is the interface where the viral S1 spike protein subunit binds. Figure 5 . Proposed mechanism of drug action for allosteric inhibitors of ACE2:S1 binding. Case I and Case II represent undesired stabilization of the ACE2:S1 complex.

Given the importance of zinc for function we deemed it necessary to include zinc for all smina docking runs. Notably, SSnet was originally trained on structural models independent of any bound metals or cofactors. As such, SSnet strips protein targets of all ligands and cofactors, including zinc. Although SSnet has proven robust in identifying high affinity drug molecules, including for metalloprotein targets, we decided it was important to examine if the presence of zinc may alter predicted affinities from SSnet. To force SSnet to consider ligands in the presence of zinc, smiles strings were modified to include zinc in a manner that mimics co-analysis (or co-administration) of zinc and each ligand. Noteworthy is the fact that SSnet considers metal binding to the protein. Further, SSnet can recognize multiple ligands such as Ferrous cysteine glycinate (Fe 2+ and cysteine glycinate) and it is therefore capable to consider both Fe 2+ and cysteine glycinate together. Comparison of the SSnet scores with and without zinc revealed unexpected results that may impact analysis of compounds selective for the open and S1-complex structures Figure 6 and Table S4 . Correlations of SSnet with and without zinc, indicate the inclusion of zinc has only a modest positive effect for most compounds. This is especially true at low and high scores, where the two methods are equivalent. In this manner, the two methods do not differ in the selection of top-binding compounds. Based on a preliminary analysis, we observed that the top 15 ligands influenced most strongly by the inclusion of zinc lie in the catalytic site near the zinc ion binding site ( Figure S4 ). Further examination reveals two aspects, which may have implications in the identification of compounds selective for the open conformation. First, the effect of zinc on SSnet scores is significantly more pronounced in structures lacking S1 (Figure 6b ). In this regard, zinc seems to enhance ligand binding in the absence of the S1 complex regardless of whether ACE2 is in the open or closed conformation. Second, the effect of zinc is most pronounced within the range of modest SSnet scores where we observed the most selective compounds. To determine whether the role of zinc in SSnet scores may be artifactual, we sorted the approved compound libraries by the difference between SSnet with zinc and SSnet without zinc. Examination of compounds with the largest SSnet score differences with and without zinc are summarized in Table S5 . Here, we observe members of the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) families. Notably, PPIs are well known to potentially cause zinc deficiencies, due to the high affinity of PPIs to zinc. Analysis of other members observed in the top 15 affected compounds, indicates that all are known to have high affinities for zinc, including an ACE-inhibitor and ACE2 receptor blocker. These results strongly suggest that zinc may preferentially enhance binding to the ACE2 receptor that may be particularly relevant to compounds selective to the uncomplexed vs. ACE2-S1 complex structures. Based on these results, we tabulated the top compounds with SSnet(Zn) scores based on the difference between ACE2 in the open conformation and ACE2:S1 complex in the closed conformation in order to identify any that may be zinc dependent (Table S6) .

However, the comparison of smina affinity scores for these large molecules is complicated by poor 3D structures in molecular databases. Further, high degree of flexibility and conformational degrees of freedom limits the ability to identify the highest affinity pose, as demonstrated by a high average of absolute deviations for some of these compounds.

It is important to mention that a normal screening values-based sorting would have not provided such insight as estradiol derivatives are not in the high scoring area. Ulterior information from the clustering on the heatmap can be used to extrapolate how small groups affect the selectivity towards the ACE2 or the ACE2:S1 complex. Figure 8 shows that the highest selectivity is achieved for ACE2 binders with binding probabilities in the range 0.60-0.70.

Interestingly, these molecules selectively bind to the virus-incompetent ACE2 open conformation, giving an indication of the validity of our model of drug action. We found that hormones, and in particular estriol metabolites are amongst our tightest binding compounds in smina, and have SD scores exceeding 0.20 for SSnet. In the case of all hormones, we observe that they are binding adjacent to the Zn 2+ binding site required for the function of ACE2, and the primary site differentiating the open and closed conformations. Notably, previous computational screens neglect this site, as it is not directly in the ACE2:spike interface, however, the site does modulate conversion between the open and closed conformation that is believed to be necessary for Spike recognition.
