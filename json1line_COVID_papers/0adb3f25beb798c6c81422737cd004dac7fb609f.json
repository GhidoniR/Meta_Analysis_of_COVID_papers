Measures to effect such distancing include staying at home and leaving the home for essential requirements only, maintaining a two-meter distance between oneself and others, avoiding physical greetings (hugs, kisses, and handshakes), closures of workplaces/schools, cancellations of mass gatherings, and quarantined and locked-down measures in affected areas (12, (14) (15) (16) .

though the disease has no medicine and all the believers believe that we can be cured and protected by only God, the norms and rules of the church are in-line with that of social distancing principles (for example, individuals should stand far apart from each other so that one cannot disturb the other while praying). Social events such as weddings and christening are not against the rules to prevent COVID-19 by themselves. Additionally, the top authority of the church (Sinodose) informed fellow Christians on media (television and official letters) that followers can pray from home until the pandemic is controlled. Similarly, community health workers and traffic police agreed that there are conditions that can facilitate social distancing practice. They mentioned the presence of well-organized volunteer workers at the community to enact social distancing measures, the trustworthiness of community health workers by members of the community, and top Christian and Muslim religious leaders have a good understanding and awareness concerning prevention of the disease. The decision made by the government to decrease passenger numbers by 50% in public transport and penalty measures for drivers violating this recommendation were explained by participants. A 27-year-old female community health worker with two years of working experience described how top religious leaders work alongside and cooperate with them. \u2026at one of the Orthodox Churches, many people were attending together in holy water. We informed them to avoid gatherings by explaining the effects and transmission of COVID-19. But they had assumed we were interfering with their belief. Later the religious leaders and local authorities were informed and the holy water service was temporarily closed. Another female community health worker, aged 27, also explains the impact of COVID-19 on volunteer workers and their acceptance by the community to improve the application of social distancing. She stated: \u2026since we are always working with them, they usually accept what we recommend to implement COVID-19 protection measures. In addition to the existing volunteer workers in the community, we organized volunteer groups with 10 members per village, and then selected one representative from each group. We easily communicate with the representative to transfer new information or we can take the information from those leaders on the challenges they face.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "home-to-home visit for observation and awareness creation on COVID-19, the villagers welcomed us and accepted our health education. Because they know about us and the religion we follow and that we are one of them. While others give health education through media, they are suspicious and some even may consider them as an evil spirit. They say, no one can prohibit us from going to our church. That is why the people of the community are always attending mass services at the churches crowded together. After the pandemic was reported in the country, everybody was strict to stay at home or maintain a 2-meter distance, and there were hand washing facilities at crowded places. Gradually these good practices have become less consistent. The participant raised further challenges to following social distancing measures for COVID-19 prevention: inconsistent measures by law enforcement bodies, such as tight control at houses of worship while ignoring other crowded places like open markets. Few religious leaders teach against social distancing measures and there are inconsistencies in the implementations of social distancing measures among different religious institutions. Furthermore, the absence of a strong monitoring system in crowded places like houses of worship, markets, transport stations, funerals, and weddings, also contributed to inconsistencies for implementing social distancing measures. The following excerpt from a 50-year-old man from the community described the observed challenges that exist at the community level, among religious leaders, and at a government levels as follows: The Christian followers' belief that Gondar is the country of 44 covenants and that the virus cannot attack the people of the community. When I put a face mask and gloves [on], there were people who teased and made fun of me, calling me \"corona\". I observed that in mourning people were out walking without keeping their distance. People are not giving much attention to the disease, they are walking in groups and not protecting themselves. On top of this, the government is not acting uniformly in enforcing the law (there is more strict control in house of worships while it is lenient in other places such as markets, public transportations etc.). Few religious leaders teach against the rule to prevent covid-19, affirming that they should continue their cultural and religious practice and only rely on faith of God, and leave everything else being told aside. A 50-year-old priest added: There are extra or unnecessary practices beyond the church recommendations such as dancing during christening and hugging or holding hands while mourning a deceased one which can increase the disease transmission. These are unnecessary extra practices that are not part of the religious ceremony in the church, and thus, need to be avoided in the era of covid-19.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "Abbreviations COVID: Coronavirus disease; SARS-CoV-2: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; ARDS: acute respiratory distress syndrome; RT-PCR: reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; US: United States; IRB: Institutional Review Board.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Compliance with social distancing measures and activities related to social distancingOut of 401 participants included in the quantitative study, 55.4% (95% CI 50.4, 60.2), reported poor compliance with social distancing measures.

Total closure of the church and prohibiting followers not to go church is not a good solution. A 40-year-old man from the religious community suggested additional solutions as follows: \u2026Without complete restriction of religious followers from the church, limit the number of attendants on mass prayers like \"kidassie\". Similar measures must be taken to other crowded places like market to be consistent with all social distancing practice. However, avoiding social life is impossible. It is very difficult to deal with grief alone but limiting the number of individuals attending funeral is a good option.
