Teaching is online and the teacher and learners are physically separated (in terms of place, time, or both). One of the biggest challenges to educators during the covid pandemic was virtual teaching which became the sole mode of communication. Virtual teaching has its advantages namely, convenience of access, wide global reach, inclusive content and collaborations across the globe. However, it has it's disadvantages too: essentially the lack of face-to-face interaction and the human element. The present talk describes our experiences with virtual teaching of astronomy with the help of astronomy data and Virtual Observatory tools.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In the early April 2020, we collaborated with Jana Vigyan Vedika (JVV) Telangana which is a member organisation of the All Indian People Science Network (AIPSN) and a member of the National Council for Science and Technology Communication (NCSTC) in India.

The project trained students to use the high-quality astronomy data from various facilities. Participants were shown step-by-step techniques of accessing and analysing astronomy data from the internet, introduced to virtual observatory tools and programmimg techniques, and supported to formulate and develop projects.
