The future implications of this work can be further explored for purposes of urban regeneration studies. The city of Milan occupies a strategic geographical position in central Europe. Milan has undergone significant urbanization during the years of \"economic boom\" after the second world war (WWII), expanding into predominantly agricultural lands at the outskirts of the city. In the last few decades, the changes have affected mainly the already dense urban fabric.

In order to evaluate the most suitable band combination for inspection over time (multitemporal data analysis), it was chosen to examine how the information observed from satellite correspond to ground truth data. In this case, two series of information have been used as ground truth data [9] : Preparing DUSAF Data for Comparison of Classified Satellite Imagery. In order to compare selected Combinations to DUSAF ground truth data, the original categories had to be re-classified. As shown in Fig. 2 , the DUSAF legend categories have been combined into fewer classes in order to make the distinction between built environment (infrastructures and buildings) and green areas more straightforward.

Classification of Band Combinations 1 and 2. In order to make satellite imagery comparable to DUSAF data, it was chosen to classify them also into 5 classes. The supervised method was firstly tested but eventually abandoned as it was not possible to read spectral signatures of different features and create proper regions of reference with only three bands. The three band 2015 LS5 images have been hence classified using Unsupervised classification method and then converted into vector shape files (Fig. 3) . The images were then inserted into a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) QGIS environment for further analysis [10] . The use of open source GIS environment was a benefit to this paperthe environment has been tested for robustness and stability for investigation of both Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. In fact, experts evaluate FOSS a mature and reliable technology for geo-data management [11] . From the first visual investigation, first three classes seem to indicate built areas with no distinction between buildings and streets (Class 1 and 2 from Table 4 ), two other classes seemed to indicate better green areas respectively classes 3 and 4 of Table 4 , while Class 5 was not represented (it seemed to be incorporated into Class 4). It was hence chosen to represent satellite imagery in this manner: Distinguishable classes 1, 2 and 3 were represented in three shades of red (dark red, red and orange); while Distinguishable classes 4 and 5 have been represented in light and dark green. The areas of these five distinguishable classes were hence calculated for both Combination imagery and compared to DUSAF classes as shown in Table 5 . From the first visual inspection, it seemed that Combination 2 i.e. the band combination with reference to Landsat 5 bands B7-6-4 (i.e. Landsat 8 B7-5-3) is a more suitable one for identification of urban changes. This was further investigated by calculating compatibility percentage with DUSAF Classes. For purposes of this comparison, the area DUSAF Class 5 Water bodies was incorporated into Class 4 Agriculture areas.

Agriculture areas are as well underestimated with pretty good results in Combination 2 (order of 10%). The high number of underestimation for all green areas (column 4 of Table 6 ) can be explained with the fact that Class 3 features are too small to be detected by 30 m resolutionhence while calculated in DUSAF maps because documented on a specific layer, these are not easily detected neither in Combination 1 nor 2.

PCA is a frequently employed technique for image analysis and pattern detection applied in domains using satellite imagery and image fusion. Given the multi-spectral i.e. multi-dimensional nature of remotely sensed data, it is very often observed that the measured variables have significant level of correlation among them, causing redundancy of information. PCA is a transformation procedure that organizes the original variables (spectral bands) into a new set of variables as a novel linear combination. When the linear functions used in the process are not correlated among each, other they are called \"principal components\" (PCs). Such process summarizes the original information into fewer dimensions, where the most of the information is contained within first few PCs [12] .
