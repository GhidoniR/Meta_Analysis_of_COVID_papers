This study determined the level of implementation of the document in a tertiary hospital in Southwest Nigeria. Methods: this was a cross-sectional descriptive study among HCWs in a tertiary hospital in South-western Nigeria that assessed the level of implementation of the WHO COVID-19 RRRHW document using a closed ended structured questionnaire. Results: five hundred and thirty-five HCWs participated in the study comprising 165(30.8%) males and 370(69.2%) females. Majority (87.3%) of the HCWs were 40 years and below. One hundred and sixty-three (30.5%) of the HCWs had been involved in the care of COVID-19 patients; less than 60% of the respondents were aware of the presence of an official platform for dissemination of information on suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 435(81.3%) were aware of hospital training on Infection Prevention and Control (IPC); 191(35.7%) have had uninterrupted supplies of personal protective equipment(PPE) and IPC materials; 211(39.4%) were aware of mental and counselling services in the hospital while only 106(19.8%) knew how to access these services; 289(54%) have attended IPC training and 307(57.4%) are able to don and doff PPE.

The outbreak which started in Wuhan, China has gradually spread to 215 countries [1] . The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus as a pandemic in March 2020 [2] . Over 22,208,491 cases and 781,536 deaths have been recorded globally as at 20 th August, 2020 [1] . The first case of the virus was recorded in Nigeria in February 2020 in an Italian citizen who came into the country on a flight from northern Italy [3] . Between February and August, a total of 49, 895 cases have been confirmed in 36 States of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory with 981 deaths recorded as at 18 th August, 2020 [4] . The increase in the number of cases has not been without consequences as facilities and personnel required for management of patients are getting strained. This pandemic has placed huge pressure on Nigeria\u00b4s already fragile healthcare system which has been further aggravated by the mass exodus of medical practitioners in recent times. As much as there is need to pay attention to health care delivery and access to care for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID- 19) patients and suspected cases, in keeping with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) [5] , it is equally crucial that the rights of health care workers (HCWs) at the forefront of managing the pandemic are equally adequately protected. The need to ensure protection of HCWs was equally also emphasized by the International Partnership for Universal Health Coverage 2030 (UHC2030) [6] . Relying on earlier studies, Shah et al. [7] reported a total number of 1,716 infected health personnel as of February 11, 2020 [8] . The WHO in early May 2020, reported infection of 945 HCWs in 28 counties in the African region with South Africa having the highest number of infected HCWs. Before mid-May 2020, Nigeria has become the most affected in the African region with 401 HCWs infected [9] . By 26 th May, 2020, Nigeria still retained the highest number with 606 HCWs having been infected with the coronavirus [9] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 198, "end": 201, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 293, "end": 296, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 393, "end": 396, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 548, "end": 551, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 743, "end": 746, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1206, "end": 1209, "text": "19)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1339, "end": 1342, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1633, "end": 1636, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1679, "end": 1682, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1748, "end": 1769, "text": "February 11, 2020 [8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2032, "end": 2035, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2156, "end": 2159, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "With the increasing number of infected HCWs, additional pressure is being put on the other HCWs in various hospitals to put in extra hours to cover the work of those who are ill or on isolation. It is thus imperative that adequate measures are put in place to protect them. To this end, the WHO recognizing the need to protect HCWs as frontline workers in combating the COVID-19 pandemic, released the COVID-19 outbreak: rights, roles and responsibilities of health workers, including key considerations for occupational safety and health document in March 2020 (COVID-19 RRRHW document) [10] . The COVID-19 RRRHW document contains both rights and corresponding responsibilities. It highlights the responsibilities of employers of HCWs; responsibilities of HCWs and the rights of HCWs. Whilst the responsibilities on the part of the employers and HCWs are not unusual, the rights of HCWs which can be reasonably implied from the employer\u00b4s responsibilities create a clear departure from the usual norm. The usual focus has always been on protection of patients who are considered vulnerable in the medical practitioner-patient relationship especially from the view point of medical ethics which Draper and Sorell accurately described as being 'one-sided' [11] . The increased vulnerability of HCWs to infection in this COVID-19 era clearly justifies the need to highlight, recognize and implement their rights. The following rights of HCWs can be clearly inferred from the COVID-19 RRRHW document: 1) Right to information, instruction and training on occupational safety and health (OSH) and infection prevention and control (IPC); 2) Right to adequate supply of IPC and personal protective equipment (PPE) and training on use; 3) Right to a blame-free environment which allows HCWs to freely report incidents relating to exposures, cases of violence and the right of victims of violence and exposures to needed support; 4) Right to report symptoms and to stay home when ill without being required to return to work where there is continuing or serious danger to life or health, until the employer has taken the necessary remedial action; 5) Right to appropriate working hours with breaks; 6) Right to abstain from work without undue consequences where there is reasonable justification to believe that the situation at work presents an imminent and serious danger to their life or health; 7) Right to compensation, rehabilitation and treatment if infected with COVID-19 following exposure in the workplace; and 8) Right to access mental health and counselling services.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 588, "end": 592, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1255, "end": 1259, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Consistent with the above rights, the employers of HCWs have corresponding responsibilities to ensure that measures are put in place to prevent violation of these rights. The COVID-19 RRRHW document also imposes clear obligations on HCWs including responsibility to follow established OSH procedures; to avoid exposure of others to health and safety risks; to participate in employerprovided OSH trainings; to use provided protocols to assess, triage and to treat patients; to treat patients with respect, compassion and dignity; to maintain patient confidentiality; to swiftly follow established public health reporting procedures of suspected and confirmed cases; to provide or reinforce accurate IPC and public health information to patients and the community; to put on, use, take off and dispose of PPEs properly; to self-monitor for signs of illness and self-isolate or report illness to managers, if it occurs; to inform management if they are experiencing signs of undue stress or mental health challenges that require support interventions; and to report to their immediate supervisor any situation which they have reasonable justification to believe presents an imminent and serious danger to life or health [10] . Notwithstanding the release of the COVID-19 RRRHW document in March, 2020, the rate of infection of HCWs in Nigeria has continued to increase [9] . The success of the COVID-19 RRRHW document as a tool for protecting HCWs in the COVID-19 era is however, dependent on the extent to which HCWs and indeed all stakeholders are aware of, and committed to the implementation of this document. The aim of this study therefore, was to assess the practices and measures put in place to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in University of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital Complex, (UNIMEDTHC) Ondo State, Southwest Nigeria during the pandemic and determine the level of implementation of WHO-COVID-19 RRRHW policy document. To the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of any similar study conducted in Nigeria.

Although fairly commendable, however there is a need for the hospital management to work towards uninterrupted supply of these IPC supplies at all service points in order to limit spread of infection within the hospital. Previous reports have alluded to the fact that there was a global challenge with uninterrupted supplies of PPE in both developing and developed countries [17] [18] [19] . Inadequate supplies of PPEs were also reported among HCWs in United States, United Kingdom, Africa, Pakistan and India [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Factors responsible for this global challenge included limited financial resources to procure, shutting down of manufacturing companies during the pandemic, panic purchase of large quantity of PPE by people in anticipation of future hike in price and out of stock and hoarding of PPEs by business owners in order to maximize profit. There have been insinuations that this shortage of PPE contributed to high rate of COVID-19 infection and mortality among HCWs in different countries.

Workplace violence among HCWs have received considerable attention of the WHO because of the negative impact it has on their fundamental human rights; psychological and physical well-being; productivity and job satisfaction [24] . This could further compound the burden already imposed on these HCWs in the present COVID-19 pandemic. The hospital management needs to put in place adequate measures that will protect the rights of HCWs and protect them from work place violence by possibly adopting and implementing the WHO framework guidelines for addressing workplace violence in the health sector [24] . pandemic. The compensation may be for those who had to put in extra hours beyond what is expected of them, those who are frontline HCWs in the management of COVID-19, those who become infected in the line of duty, and those who eventually succumb to COVID-19. This is meant to encourage them and allay the fears of what the future holds in case they succumb to COVID-19 or suffer any permanent injury in the line of duty. Following the onset of COVID-19, 46.2% of our study population had worked for extra hours; 18.1% had gone on self-isolation following contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 30.5% had been involved in the care of suspected COVID-19 patients. This showed the level of risk HCWs are exposed to during the pandemic and the need for adequate compensation. However, the process of compensation and rehabilitation has not been set in motion in the hospital possibly because it goes beyond what could be handled at the level of hospital management without government intervention. This issue requires holistic approach that would involve formulation and implementation of policies; legislation of laws; and executive approval by the government. Presently, the frontline workers in the state owned IDH do not have concrete insurance plans to guarantee their safety in the course of discharging their responsibilities. In Nigeria, HCWs have always lamented the lack of government\u00b4s commitment to their welfare. This also came to the fore in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic when it became public knowledge that the hazard allowance paid to Nigerian HCWs was less than 150 USD per annum. After several consultations, the federal government agreed to pay HCWs 50% of their basic salary as COVID-19 allowance for three months. Despite this agreement, the government still failed to pay the allowance until the Association of Resident Doctors embarked on industrial action which almost paralyzed the health sector and with fatal consequences amidst the COVID-19 pandemic [25] . Even till date, several State government HCWs have not received their allowances and others are planning to embark on industrial action.

The hospital has not put a formal structure in place to provide psychological support for HCWs. HCWs especially those taking care of patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk of developing psychological disorders such as stress, insomnia, anxiety and depression [26] [27] [28] [29] . Factors responsible for increased psychological burden among HCWs include absence of definitive cure for COVID-19; high infectivity of the virus; limited PPE; fear of getting infected by the virus and subsequently exposing friends and family members to the disease; and increased working hours. Also, HCWs are faced with discrimination and stigmatization in the society where the people see them as a potential source of the infection [30, 31] . In addition, the peculiarity of long waiting time between sample collections and collection of results may also contribute to the psychological burden of HCWs. It takes an average of one week for COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test result to come out due to limited COVID-19 diagnostic facilities in Southwest Nigeria. This waiting time is characterized by apprehension, agitation, anxiety and palpable fear of the unknown. Therefore, it is highly imperative that the psychological needs of HCWs should be prioritized and met. The WHO advocates provision of mental support and counseling to HCWs. Xiao et al. [27] reported that psychological support given to frontline HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic improved their quality of sleep, self-efficacy and reduced their level of stress and anxiety. In line with the WHO COVID-19 RRRHW document, the hospital needs to ensure that the HCWs are aware of the availability of mental health services while also reinforcing the counselling unit.

Also, only a third of the respondents had undergone training on OSH. There is need to improve on this aspect of training, because it is essential for HCWs to know how to stay safe at their work place while caring for patients, especially those with COVID-19. About two-third of respondents had been involved in the education of patients, relatives and the larger community on COVID-19. However, because the opinions of HCWs are highly respected and valued in the communities, there is a need to maximize their positive influence in community. They can assist in emphasizing the importance of regular hand washing, social distancing, cough etiquette and also help to debunk the myths surrounding COVID-19. The limitation of this study was that it was a quantitative study which relied on recall of information by respondents; therefore, there may be some form of bias in their responses.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Presence of COVID-19 response team and infection prevention control committee (IPCC):"}, {"text": "The rate of infection of HCWs in Nigeria has continued to increase since the first COVID-19 case was discovered in Nigeria in February, 2020.The release of the COVID-19 RRRHW document by the WHO was to guarantee increased protection of the rights and welfare of HCWs amidst the pandemic. However, this study revealed low level of implementation of the document with need for increased attention by the government and all stakeholders in ensuring the protection of the rights and welfare of HCWs. Issues of compensation and rehabilitation of HCWs; protection of HCWs from violence; access to counselling services to ensure the mental well-being of HCWs; access to information, training, adequate PPEs and IPC for their protection are areas requiring urgent attention. Implementation of the document will guarantee improved protection of rights of HCWs with a consequential decrease in rate of infection among them.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "Recommendations: the need for increased effort to ensure that delay between sample collection and release of COVID-19 test results of HCWs is addressed cannot be over-emphasized. This will not only prevent prolonged anxieties, but will also ensure that HCWs who are positive are immediately isolated without exposing their patients and other HCWs to risk of infection. This study recommends the creation of a proper and formal structure to prevent violence against HCWs in the discharge of their duties and to provide psychological support and counselling for HCWs to enable them cope with increased stress in the discharge of their duties during the pandemic. Also, IPC trainings should be more regularly conducted with mandatory step-down trainings by heads of respective units. A dedicated COVID-19 response team that will be responsible for the care of COVID patients in the hospital should also be created to limit spread of infection among HCWs. Lastly, there is need for increased commitment to the welfare of HCWs on the part of the government. Government should not allow matters to degenerate to the level of strike actions before key demands relating to the welfare and well-being of HCWs are met.
