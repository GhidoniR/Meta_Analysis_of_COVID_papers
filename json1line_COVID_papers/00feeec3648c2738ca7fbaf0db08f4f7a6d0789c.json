Further, it was identified that the drivers of the short term process, in addition to historical data, also takes into consideration the aspects of state of the market as a whole. The proposed setup was then empirically analyzed in the context of copper prices, while recognizing the feasibility of the same in case of other commodities. The authors, recognizing that the transition from the short term to long term process, leading upto the \"global\" setup is non-trivial, carried out the same through empirical data analysis. Further, they cited existing literature to surmise that the long-term dynamics is triggered typically between the third and fourth year of the period under consideration. Accordingly, the global process was modeled using a linear combination of the short term and the long term processes.

These two factors were then collated to model the dynamics for the spot prices of the commodities. While estimation of the equilibrium price levels can be estimated from price movement of commodity futures with long maturity, the short-term behavior of the prices can be inferred from the price difference between short term and long term futures, and the model was validated using the prices of oil futures. In a detailed study [3] , Hilliard and Reis, investigated the impact of stochastic yields and interest rates, along with jumps in spot price, in the pricing of commodity derivatives. In particular, the authors modeled the spot prices as a jump-diffusion process, and also an equilibrium convenience yield diffusion. A two factor model was used for valuation of futures and options. This was then extended for three factors, as well as three factor jump-diffusion valuation model. In the context of our work, one of the assumptions in [3] , is that the net marginal rate of yield of the commodity follows a mean-reverting process. In [4] , the authors presented logarithmic mean reversion models for commodity pricing. Schwartz [5] , presented a comparative analysis for three stochastic models for commodity prices, by considering a mean-reversion process, in the paradigm of predictive modeling of futures prices, as well as their valuation vis-a-vis, other derivatives and assets. The comprehensive analysis undertaken in the paper, gave credence to the premise that there exists a strong mean reversion factor when it comes to pricing of commodities. Hart et al. [6] attributed the lack of existence of options on agricultural commodities, with maturity exceeding a year, to the lack of option pricing mechanism, in case of commodities, whose spot prices can be encapsulated by a mean-reversion process. Accordingly, they proposed and analyzed a model to account for the mean-reversion in the spot prices, and the model also corrected for seasonal influences, motivated by the empirical observance of both mean-reversion and seasonal influence, in case of price dynamics in soybean markets. In [7] , Bernard et al. carried out a detailed comparative analysis of several approaches, namely, GARCH, jump-diffusion and mean reversion, to forecast commodity prices.

This motivated the consideration of a time lag factor, i.e., the instantaneous drift term will be a function of the price of the commodity at some earlier time point.

For instance if there's a sharp rise in prices, the profitability of the commodity, increases, which gives the industry an incentive to increase the supply, which subsequently reduces the prices. Similarly, if there is a fall in the prices, the profitability reduces and it is likely that the industry will reduce supply, and thus prices would increase. However for most of the industries, like that of base metals, it is unlikely that producers will bring changes in production immediately, as a response to the market information. It is more likely that the industry will respond with a delay to the market information. This response time (\u03c4 ) serves as the order of our HOM process. Another significant advantage of a HOM model is that the speed of inversion is significantly lower than a Markovian model. This implies that the price can drop significantly below the mean.
