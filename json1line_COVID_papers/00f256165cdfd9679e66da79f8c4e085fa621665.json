WLPs then disappeared in March 1989 and were not detected despite continuous monitoring until two herds were seen in 1991 6 . Herd size grew very slowly and by 2005 the population reached normal to high density. In Guyana, intensive research over 3.5 years described a WLP population with high densities up until June 2010, when this study ended 9,14 . WLPs then disappeared over the course of one year and their absence was documented starting in 2011 by camera trapping, transect surveys and hunter reports for the following 7 years (S2). They had not reappeared as of 2019 in most areas. Population absences or very low abundances for 23 cases in contiguous forest lasted on average 10.3 years (SD = 4.9), with 50% lasting between 7 and 12 years. Some populations lows were well documented through long-term field research. For example, in contiguous forest regions of the Amazon biome in French Guiana, WLPs were continuously monitored between 2000 and 2019. They were at normal abundances throughout the state in 2000 and 2001. Monitoring revealed a geographically expanding disappearance starting in 2003, reaching almost complete absence from 2006 to 2009 across the entire region. During 2012 and 2013, WLPs reappeared in several locations. Longer lasting disappearances are reported from discontinuous forests outside the Amazon. In the 41,704-ha Intervales State Park, an Atlantic Forest fragment in S\u00e3o Paulo State, WLPs disappeared in 1990 and reappeared in 2017 after a 27-year absence. In the larger Igua\u00e7u National Park and adjacent northern Misiones province in Argentina, WLPs disappeared around 1995. Years of surveys confirmed their absence until several individuals were detected with camera traps in 2016, likely immigrating from nearby forested areas in Argentina 22 . In Turvo State Park (Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil), WLPs disappeared in 1980 and have not been seen since then (S1). More than one disappearance event has been documented through time at several sites, pointing to periodicity in the phenomenon. In and around Manu National Park, Peru, WLPs disappeared in 1978, reappeared 12 years later, then disappeared again in 2011. A few individuals were detected in 2015, but as of 2019, the population had not returned to pre-disappearance levels. Two distinct disappearance events occurred in the 275,531-ha Juta\u00ed River Extractive Reserve, located in continuous, undisturbed forest in western Amazonas state, Brazil. Local inhabitants reported the start of the first disappearance between 1998-2002, with the timing depending on the location within the reserve. WLPs reappeared between 2006-2011, with the timing again depending on the site (S2). Researchers were present for the second disappearance, which began in 2013 near the mouth of the river (S2). By 2014 WLPs had also disappeared from the adjacent section of the watershed and in 2015 from the more distant headwater region. WLPs have not yet been detected at any location in the reserve. In Madidi National Park, Bolivia, WLPs disappeared in 1984 for 10 to 14 years, then reached normal densities for several years, and disappeared again in mid-2017 along the Heath river, followed by the Tuichi and Hondo rivers in 2018 (S2).

Emmons15 proposed a local disease outbreak for a WLP disappearance that occurred in Manu National Park, Peru, and Fragoso 5,6 postulated epidemic outbreaks at regional scales after documenting a disappearance in northern Roraima, Brazil. Our study documented rapid declines in abundance, characteristic of catastrophic events such as disease in which individuals experience severe physiological stress that affect both maintenance andreproduction 1,36,37 . It is still an open question for WLPs whether disease outbreaks could drive populations cycles, on their own or in synchrony with other stressors. WLP are notoriously difficult to study--their long-distance daily movements, and their aggressive behavior towards hunters and predators make them difficult to capture even under normal circumstances. Future efforts among a network of researchers and community collaborators, with improved technologies and the expansion of biodiversity monitoring programs in the most remote Amazonia regions, should be feasible to establish to finally understand the mysterious WLP disappearances and confirm the details and causes of the population cycles documented in this study. 35.
