Nonetheless, a wide gap exists between the LDL-C target recommended (LDL < 55 mg/dL) by ESC guidelines and the prescription criteria adopted by the Italian drug regulatory agency (AIFA) (LDL 100 mg/dL). The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of patients within this gap and their risk of cardiovascular events in a real-world cohort. Methods and results: We conducted a retrospective analysis of a monocentric observational registry prospectively enrolling patients admitted to our hospital for ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and followed-up in our dedicated post-myocardial infarction (PMI) ambulatory. We considered the combined endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as a composite of all-cause death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke and unplanned revascularization. LDL-C was collected at baseline and during follow-up; the lower value at follow-up was used to define the achievement of the target. We conducted a Kaplan-Meier analysis and logrank test comparing patients who achieved LDL-C < 55 mg/dL (group A) vs. those with LDL-C between 55 and 100 mg/dL (group B). Continue variable are presented as median (interquartile range). A total of 814 patients (23% female) were included in the analysis. Median age was 63 (55-72) years, 57% had hypertension, 19% diabetes, and 36% were smokers. Median follow-up was 52 (34-66) months. A total of 83.3% of patients were treated with statin therapy alone (73% high intensity), and 15.3% with the addition of ezetimibe. LDL-C < 55 mg/dL was achieved in 244 patients (30%), 55 patients had LDL-C > 100 mg/dL, while 515 patients (63%) remained in the gap between 55 and 100 mg/dL. High intensity statin and ezetimibe prescription was not significantly different between group A and B (respectively 86% vs. 87.9%; P \u00bc 0.45 and 11.6 vs. 17%; P \u00bc 0.06). The net incidence of MACE was 16.4% in group A vs. 23.9% in group B (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.49-0.94; P log-rank \u00bc 0.02; Number Needed to Treat \u00bc 13; see Figure) . Conclusion: The majority of PMI patients, despite high intensity lipid-lowering therapy, fail to reach the recommended LDL-C target in a real-world cohort. Importantly, the prognosis of patients with LDL-C values between 55 and 100 mg/dL was significantly worse than that of patients achieving values <55 mg/dL. A discussion with healthcare authorities is warranted to improve the prescription of PCSK9 inhibitors in this very high-risk cohort of patients in line with current guidelines recommendation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2315, "end": 2322, "text": "Figure)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Division of Cardiology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico, San Matteo, Pavia, Italy"}, {"text": "Luca Moderato 1 , Simone Binno 1 , Davide Lazzeroni 2 , Maria Teresa Di Dio 1 , and Daniela Aschieri 1 1 Ospedale Guglielmo da Saliceto -Piacenza, 2 Fondazione Don Gnocchi, IRCCS, MILANO Aims: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a leading cause of death worldwide. It accounts for up to 50% of all cardiovascular deaths. The incidence of OHCA in Italy is about 1.51 arrests/1000 admission/year. Recent studies have sought to find a link between short-term exposure to air pollutants and OHCA. It is well established that ambient air pollution triggers cardiovascular fatal and nonfatal events, but the results are still controversial. Most studies on this subject were performed in developed countries with only a paucity of data from Asia, where air pollution is increasingly becoming a major healthcare issue. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of short-term exposure to outdoor air pollutants on the incidence of OHCA in Piacenza, Italy.
