Therefore laboratories have to evaluate different diagnostic assays and establish them in laboratory workflows at once. To complicate this assessment even further, laboratories were, and still are, confronted with supply shortages of disposables, technical equipment and/or reagents.

Of particular challenge are clinical samples with Ct values close to the detection limit of the PCR assays. In the current study only one of the manufacturers specified Ct values > 35 as within the detection limit. Therefore, repeating the test and obtaining a similar result is suitable to confirm a true positive result. Another helpful tool to improve the true positive rate is the design of multiple targets. Thus non-specific and true positive results can be differentiated more easily (Colton et al., 2021) .
