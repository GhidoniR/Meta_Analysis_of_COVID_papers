In this method, a novel variant of a gravitational search algorithm is employed for obtaining optimal clusters. To validate the performance of the proposed variant, a comparative analysis among recent metaheuristic algorithms is conducted. The experimental study includes two sets of benchmark functions, namely standard functions and CEC2013 functions, belonging to different categories such as unimodal, multimodal, and unconstrained optimization functions. The performance comparison is evaluated and statistically validated in terms of mean fitness value, Friedman test, and box-plot. Further, the presented clustering method tested against three different types of publicly available CoVID19 medical images, namely X-ray, CT scan, and Ultrasound images.

Pathogenically, the virus identified in CoVID19 is \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\" (SARS-CoV-2) which is quite distinct from other respiratory viruses like MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, avian influenza, and influenza [3] . Usual symptoms in a COVID19 patient are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Other signs experienced by patients include sore throat, diarrhea, headache, loss of taste Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur, India or smell, and rash on the skin and severely infected patients have symptoms of breathing difficulty, chest pain, and Multi-Organ Failure (MOF) [4] . Despite worldwide efforts to control the growth of CoVID19, the number of CoVID19 incidences is still rising at a reproduction rate of 3.77 [5] . Globally, there are over 6.15 million confirmed cases, out of which more than 2.63 million patients have recovered while 371,700 patients died, as of the date (1 June 2020) [6] . Moreover, USA with more than 1.8 million confirmed cases is the most severely affected country, followed by Brazil, Russia, United Kingdom, Spain, and Italy, with more than 200 thousand confirmed cases to date. India, being the second-largest population country, has also a significant rise in the number of CoVID19 cases. At the time of this writing article, there are nearly around 200 thousand confirmed cases in India with a death count of 5,394.

However, it has been observed that this method has several limitations, such as time-consuming, low true-positive rates, and high false-negative rates [7, 8] . Due to the high communicable behavior of CoVID19, such limitations raises a major concern in the current Fig. 1 Representative sample images of non-CoVID19 patients: a chest Xray, b chest CT-scan, and c lung Ultrasound epidemic situation. If an infected person is not diagnosed and treated timely, then the infected person may act as a carrier of the virus and spread it among healthy people unknowingly. Therefore, early identification of the infected people would help to quarantine them, which would be advantageous in declining the growth of CoVID19. As an alternative, clinical observations [9] have observed high sensitivity in diagnosing the CoVID19 through medical imaging modalities. There are irregular groundglass opacities in chest images of the infected people [10] . Figures 1 and 2 illustrate representative samples of three medical imaging modalities, i.e. chest X-ray, chest CTscan, and lung ultrasound images, of non-CoVID19 and CoVID19 patients, respectively. In general, the manual analysis of such images requires expert radiologists which makes this costly and error-prone process. To alleviate the same, computer-aided methods could facilitate as diagnostic aids for CoVID19. Fang et al. [11] has observed that the diagnosis of CoVID19 through imaging patterns in the chest images is much accurate than RT-PCR. Similar observations are also reported by Xie et al. [12] . Recently, many supervised learning methods have been proposed in which the concept of transfer learning is mainly applied in which a pre-trained deep learning model is used as a feature extractor. Deep learning models are not employed directly due to the unavailability of a large dataset of labeled chest images for CoVID19. Therefore, researchers have extracted deep features through transfer learning, and then, classification is performed through supervised models like decision tree, AdaBoost, support vector machine, and many more [4, 13] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 109, "end": 112, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 266, "end": 269, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 270, "end": 272, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 871, "end": 874, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1049, "end": 1053, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1486, "end": 1490, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1662, "end": 1666, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2206, "end": 2209, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2210, "end": 2213, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 380, "end": 386, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1056, "end": 1071, "text": "Figures 1 and 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Literature has witnessed that the accuracy attained by supervised learning on deep features, i.e. features extracted through transfer learning, is around 90%.

Kmeans method clusters the unlabelled dataset into distinct unified clusters according to certain similarity measure [19] . Sometimes, Kmeans method suffers from a number of demerits like, biased towards initial clusters, converges pre-maturely, and produces local optima [20] . To mitigate such limitations, metaheuristic methods have been successful for clustering [21, 22] . Metaheuristic methods are mathematical models that mimic the unique optimization behavior of the natural systems [23] . Generally, metaheuristic methods have exhibited good performance on numerous nonlinear and complex optimization problems [24] [25] [26] . From the last two decades, they have been an integral part of many real-world applications ranging from design to business planning [27, 28] . Some popular metaheuristic methods are genetic algorithm [29] , differential algorithm [30] , particle swarm optimization [31] , ant colony optimization [32] , biogeography-based optimizer [33] , and artificial bee colony [34] . There are many other phenomena in nature that have been utilized for solving other types of realworld problems [35] . One such common phenomenon is Newton's law of gravity and motion which inspired Rashedi et al. [36] to introduce a new metaheuristic method termed as gravitational search algorithm (GSA). Gravitational search algorithm (GSA) has achieved effective results on many optimization problems like image segmentation, energy conservation, parameter selection, and clustering. A comprehensive survey of different applications of GSA is reviewed in [37] . The prominent attribute of GSA is the gravitational interaction among the considered solutions which makes it a unique and stable method [38] . Moreover, it updates solutions based on the fitness of each solution and distance among them, [39] .

On the same lines, Wang et al. [44] used a modified inception model instead of CNN to obtain 89.5% accuracy. Further, Hemdan et al. [45] performed a comparative study of various deep learning models on the chest X-ray images and reported the best accuracy of 90.00%. However, Sethy et al. [46] extracted deep features from the X-ray images and then trained the support vector machine to classify between positive and negative cases. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 95.38%. Further, Wang and Wong [47] modeled a deep learning framework, COVID-Net, for multi-class classification of chest X-ray images among normal, bacterial infection, viral infection, and CoVID19 infection. This study achieved an accuracy of 83.5%. For similar classes, Farooq and Hafeez [48] utilized a pretrained ResNet-50 architecture and reported an accuracy of 96.23%. Further, Maghdid et al. [49] employed supervised methods on features obtained through AlexNet and obtained an accuracy of 94.00%. In literature, GSA has been modified or hybridized with different characteristics to improve its performance on various types of non-linear, non-differentiable, and large search space problems. Shaw et al. [50] used the concept of opposition-based learning to propose opposition-based GSA (OGSA), which achieved better solution precision. Chatterjee et al. [51] applied the wavelet theory in GSA and presented enhanced GSA (EGSA(I)) to improve the exploration ability. In [52] , Mirjalili et al. introduced enhanced GSA (EGSA(II)) in which the velocity parameter incorporates the exploitation feature of PSO. Sarafrazi et al. [53] introduced enhanced GSA (EGSA(III)), which modified the position parameter with disruption operator. Moreover, a modified GSA was proposed by Niknam et al. [54] by incorporating a selfadaptive mutation method in GSA. Li et al. [55] introduced chaotic behavior in the position equation and presented a chaotic gravitational search algorithm (CGSA). Mirjalili et al. [56] proposed adaptive gbest GSA (GGSA) to improve the exploitation at later iterations. Further, Khajehzadeh et al. [57] employed an adaptive maximum velocity constraint in the modified gravitational search algorithm (MGSA(I)). The modified gravitational search algorithm (MGSA(II)) [58] uses the chaotic operator to prevent premature convergence. In piecewise-GSA (PGSA), Li et al. [59] modified the gravitational constant with piecewise equation. Similarly, Li et al. [60] proposed a weighted inertia mass for each object to accelerate convergence. To reduce the centre bias behavior of GSA, Davarynejad et al. [61] introduced a mass-dispersed gravitational search algorithm (mDGSA). Moreover, a chaotic Kbest gravitational search algorithm (CKGSA) [62] introduces chaotic behavior based on logistic mapping in Kbest function. It makes GSA escape the local optima as chaos behavior has shown better-searching behavior than stochastic [58, 63] . However, chaotic behavior is dependent on initial conditions which make this biased towards the initial settings. Mittal et al. [64] proposed logarithmic Kbest GSA (LKGSA) in which Kbest function decreases logarithmically which results in allowing heavier objects to exert force for more number of iterations. However, LKGSA performs exploration for a few iterations only. It diminishes the ability of the LKGSA to explore the search space exhaustively. Further, exponential Kbest GSA (EKGSA) [65] defines the exponentially decrease in Kbest which allows Kbest function to perform exploration at an early stage and exhaustive exploitation at the later stage.

The extracted features are low in dimension, which is further utilized with other learning models to perform the classification.

Maxpooling computes the maximum value in the considered region of an image while average-pooling calculates the average value over the studied region. Usually, a filter of size 2 \u00d7 2 is moved around the image to perform down-sampling. Moreover, it has been observed in the literature that the max-pooling layer is more efficient than the average-pooling layer in CNN models comparatively.

The classification layer evaluates the probability and maps the computed feature vectors to [72] class labels. If the classification problem is binary, then the sigmoid function is usually applied in the last layer, else softmax function is used for multi-class problems.

The performance has been evaluated and statistically analyzed in terms of mean fitness value, Friedman test, and box-plot.

A similar count of non-CoVID19 images is considered from a publicly available dataset which consists of chest X-ray of patients who are infected from other viral and bacterial pneumonia like, MERS, SARS, and ARDS [85] . Further, four CNN models namely, DenseNet-161, ResNet-34, VGG-16, and MobileNet-V2 are considered to perform feature extraction as they have top-5 error value as less than 10 [70] . For feature extraction, the last layer of these pre-trained models is truncated and the remaining combination of layers, i.e. convolutional, non-linear activation, pooling, and fully-connected, are used to extract features. Table 12 tabulates the considered CNN models for TLFE along with the number of extracted features. After extracting the deep features, optimal cluster centroids are obtained through the KIGSA-C method which is used to label the considered images in two categories, namely CoVID19 and non-CoVID19. As labeled dataset is used for experimentation, the performance of the proposed method can be evaluated on different classification parameters, such as accuracy, precision, and F1-score, by comparing the predicted label with actual label [42] . Moreover, the results of the proposed KIGSA-C method is compared against two methods, i.e. Kmeans and Kmeans-based gravitational search algorithm clustering (KGSA-C).

From Table 13 , it is observable that the proposed method identifies more than 98.5% of the CoVID19 images correctly. Moreover, the false-positive rate of the proposed method is comparatively low than the other methods. In terms of false-negative, the KIGSA-C method attained competitive results.

Although many supervised models exist in the literature, the generalization of these models may suffer due to the limited availability of datasets. To remedy the same, a new clustering is presented. In the proposed method, features are extracted from the considered images through a deep learning model. The extracted features are further optimally clustered through a novel variant, improved gravitational search algorithm (IGSA). The obtained optimal cluster centroids are then used to perform the labeling of the considered images into CoVID19 and non-CoVID19. Further, the proposed variant, IGSA, has been validated against 16 recent metaheuristic algorithms over two sets of benchmark functions belonging to the three types of problems, namely unimodal, multimodal, and real parameters single-objective optimization problems of IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC), 2013. The experimental performance has been evaluated over four different functional dimensions, i.e. 10, 30, 50, and 90 and studied in terms of mean fitness value, Friedman test, and boxplot. It has been observed from experimental results that IGSA has surpassed the considered algorithms over the maximum number of benchmark problems in each dimension. Moreover, the Friedman test has statistically ranked the IGSA as the top algorithm among the considered algorithms. The analysis of the box-plots indicates that the searching behavior of IGSA is better with consistency. Thus, it can be concluded that IGSA achieves better precision with a balanced trade-off between exploration and exploitation.
