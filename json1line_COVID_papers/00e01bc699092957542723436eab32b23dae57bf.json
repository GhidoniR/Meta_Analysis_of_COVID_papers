This paper first uses the time-series (2005-2015) extended input-output database to study China's embodied energy and intensity in both normal and processing exports. Structural decomposition analysis (SDA) is then applied to analyze the driving forces behind the embodiment changes. The empirical results show that China's energy embodied in both normal and processing exports first increased in 2005-2008, dropped in 2009 due to the global financial crisis, and then rose again after 2009, and finally dropped in 2014-2015. The embodied energy in trade as a percentage of total energy consumption in China was relatively stable before and after the global financial crisis, at around 28% over the 2005-2008 period, and 22% over the 2009-2015 period. The contribution of the aggregate embodied intensity (AEI) of exports to China's aggregate energy intensity dropped from 30% in 2005 to 21% in 2015. Among China's trading partners, the United States, Japan and Korea together accounted for around half of China's embodied energy and AEI in exports in 2005, but their shares dropped to only one third in 2015.

Most of the previous embodiment studies focus on the total embodiment, such as total embodied energy or emissions. Recently, propose the aggregate embodied intensity (AEI) concept by defining the AEI indicator as the ratio of embodied energy/emissions to embodied value added using the I-O framework. The AEI can be defined at the aggregate, final demand and sectoral levels or by transmission layer to analyze the relationship between energy/emissions and value added (or GDP) from the demand perspective. At the national level, the AEI in aggregate is equivalent to the aggregate intensity (AI) indicator. The AEI indicator at the higher level can be represented as a weighted sum of the AEI indicators at the lower level. It would be valuable to study the different AEI values of normal exports and processing exports in China using the extended I-O framework. 2 This paper is an attempt to analyze China's embodied energy and intensity in normal and processing exports using the time-series (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) of Chinese extended I-O tables, and further investigate the driving forces behind the embodied energy/intensity changes using the SDA frameworks.

It is also noted that the total processing exports declined earlier in 2008, but total normal exports declined later in 2009. For normal exports, the final demand total effect generally outperformed the energy intensity effect, so that the embodied energy displays upward trends in the prior-and post-crisis sub-periods and a plunge in 2009. Interestingly, the plunge was not only due to the final demand total effect but also the energy intensity effect.
