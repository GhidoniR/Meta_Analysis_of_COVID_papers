In this study, predictors of all three components of burnout were long work hours, psychological comorbidities, fear of infection and perceived support by friends. Predictors of both emotional exhaustion and depersonalization were female gender, being a nurse, working in the hospital and being in contact with COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, in our study female gender was only associated with a reduced sense of personal accomplishment as women are more likely to experience higher levels of workfamily conflict. Furthermore, the bidirectional association between anxiety/depressive symptoms and burnout syndrome in healthcare workers is well established.
