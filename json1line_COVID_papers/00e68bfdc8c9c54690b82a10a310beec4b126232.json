The structure of beginning online instructors' perceived competencies was widely discussed, and it was also confirmed that the structure and level of online teaching competencies would be varied across countries and different cultural backgrounds. Followed U.S. theoretical framework, some studies discussed the differences between Chinese and U.S. online teaching and instructors. But how Chinese online instructors, especially beginning online instructors, perceiving the online teaching competencies, and how this framework would differ from the U.S. framework, was less discussed. To fill in this gap, this study explored the structure of Chinese beginning online instructors' competencies using the Bayesian factor analysis method. With a limited sample size, the traditional factor analysis trail reported undetermined results with three options. The results of Bayesian factor analysis indicated the three-factor solution is the most appropriate solution with the collected data. The three factors are named \"preparing and supporting online teaching,\" \"creating an appropriate environment for students' learning,\" and \"conducting appraisals of student learning.\" The contributions of this study are as follows: (1) discussing the structure of Chinese beginning online instructors' perceived competencies, (2) discussing why and how the structure of online teaching competencies varied across countries, (3) providing practical suggestions for online instructors' training programs, and (4) providing methodological guidelines in factor analysis with small sample sizes for applied researchers.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "As online learning continues to mature and evolve in higher education, both faculty and supporting staff need instruction on how to design and deliver effective online courses .

According to the 40th Chinese Internet Development Report (2020) of China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), the number of Chinese Internet users reached 940 million by June 2020, the number of online education users reached 381 million. The number of online education users grows more than 50-fold from 2001 to 2020, and this number is expected to continuously grow in the future (CNNIC, 2020) . In 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic swept the globe, millions of students participate online learning. Although online learning continues to grow, many teachers are still resistant to adopt online courses for the barriers, such as uncertainty about the effectiveness of online learning and the lack of confidence in online teaching competencies (Wingo et al. 2017) . Notably, the structure of beginning online instructors' competencies can assist faculties with online course design and delivery. Thus, a great deal of attention has been paid to online instructors' competencies, especially for beginning online instructors who have less than three years of online teaching experience. They are key members in determining the quality of future online education (Lim & Newby, 2020) . To measure the competencies of beginning online instructors, the Beginning Online Instructor Competencies Questionnaire (BOICQ) is designed with five dimensions: preparing him/herself to teach online, selecting appropriate tools, preparing learners to learn online, facilitating online learning, and conducting meaningful appraisals of student learning. The target population of BOICQ, as it was designed, is all the beginning online instructors . But the validation of BOICQ only includes a sample recruited from the beginning online instructors from the U.S. Similar to other measured abilities or skills, the construction of online instructors' perceived competencies may differ fundamentally due to different nationality, cultural background, policy, and other educational practices.
