Demand for health care expenditure increased after the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is interesting in modeling the nexus between public and private health expenditure, carbon dioxide emissions, and economic growth. To this end, the present study analyzed the nexus between public and private health care expenditure, economic growth, and environmental pollution for 36 Asian countries for the period 1991-2017. FMOLS, GMM, and quantile regression analysis confirm the EKC hypothesis in Asia. Besides, FMOLS and quantile regressions reached the reducing effects of government and private health expenditures on CO 2 emissions. While quantile regression results show that public and private health expenditures can mitigate CO 2 emissions; however, these results differ for various levels of CO 2 . Findings of quantile regression show a significant impact of both public and private health expenditures in reducing CO 2 at the 50 th and 75 th quantiles but results are insignificant for the 25 th quantile. Overall, the paper concludes that both government and private health sectors' expenditures caused CO 2 emissions to decrease in Asia and that the negative impact of the private health sector on CO 2 emissions is greater than that of the government health sector. The concluding remark is that the higher the health spending, the higher the environmental quality will be in Asia. Hence, the health administrators need to increase public and private health expenditures with an effective cost-service and energy-efficient management approach to reach sustainable health services and a sustainable environment in Asia.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Keywords EKC .

Direct effect (Halkos and Paizanos 2013) that high health expenditures have redistribution effects, which raise people's income which in turn raises the demand for a cleaner environment. After people's demand for the normal public good is fulfilled, demand for the environment will increase in case people see it as a luxury good. The indirect effect is associated with the level of Environmental Kuznets Curve; at some level, government invests in reducing air pollution while at some level environment is compromised for achieving growth (Chaabouni et al. 2016) .

Furthermore, their methodology did not use a separate measure for public and private health expenditures. Our study also employed the quantile regression method which has not been used by previous studies mention in our literature review section. Therefore, our study offers new insights into the role of public and private health care expenditure on environmental degradation. Besides the output that both government sector and private health sector expenditures caused environmental pollution to decrease in Asia, this paper also yields the output that the negative impact of the private health sector on CO 2 emissions (in absolute value) is greater than that of the government health sector. Several studies are examining the environmental impacts of health expenditure, energy use, and economic growth. Some of them prove the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. Bibi and Jamil (2020) examine the association between air pollution and economic growth based on the idea of the EKC hypothesis. The result is that the EKC hypothesis is supported in all the above-mentioned regions except in the Sub-Saharan Africa region. This result is confirmed by Isik et al. (2019) for 14 states of the USA. Amri (2018) Sileem (2016) investigates the association between environmental degradation and health costs for MENA countries the empirical results yield that CO 2 emissions contribute to the increase in public health expenditure. Qureshi et al. (2015) observe the co-movements of health expenditures and environmental indicators for 5 Asian countries and reveal that GDP per unit use of energy, forest area, and energy consumption increase the health expenditures significantly. The result of Sileem (2016) and Qureshi et al. (2015) are similar to our findings. We find that the higher the health spending, the higher the environmental quality will be in Asia. The highlights of this work are confirmed also by Atuahene et al. (2020) , Zaidi and Saidi (2018) , Chaabouni et al. (2016) , Ghorashi and Alavi Rad (2017) , and Apergis et al. (2020) . To interpret further, we might need to look at closer the trend of demand for health in Asia with increasing life expectancy, health awareness, environmental awareness, aging, and others. The medical-health expenditures increased in Asia. Asian countries have demanded more medical and insurance services in the last two decades. For instance, in South Asia (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) life expectancy and health care have improved over the past decade, after previously poor health conditions and services. They reached improved life-expectancy, reduction of maternal, infant, and under-five mortality, and control of communicable diseases in the last decade (Chin et al. 2017) . China, Japan, Singapore, Thailand, and South Korea have reached over 95% health coverage. Indonesia started to launch the UHC program in 2014 to achieve UHC within 5 years . During the post-Soviet period, there exists some increase in health expenditure in Central Asia also. The medical-health care expenses increased in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan while there is a recent decline in Kyrgyzstan (Kosherbayeva et al. 2020) .

It is expected that the medical technology market in the Asian continent will become the world's second-largest medical market due to the growing population and general awareness of health issues in Asia (GBP International 2020). This market has been in transition from an oligopoly market structure to a competitive market structure. Accordingly, the demand for health care services increased prominently in Asia. The governmental health institutions and the firms running at this competitive market offer varying medical utilization services, such as varying insurance packages with varying levels of provider coverage as is in western countries such as the USA, Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland, and others (Broek-Altenburg and Atherly 2020). The transition of medical services and reforms in Asia from a supply-oriented structure to a demand-oriented structure might have encouraged the private sector to spend/ invest more in the health sector. Both government and the private sector should consider managing the cost and utilization of medical services. Besides the private sector's increasing volume of investment in the health sector, the private sector could manage better the cost-utilization packages by considering environmentally friendly hospital buildings, medical waste, and/or the electricity usage from renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and biomass energy.

Afterward, the best practices which might include eco-friendly investment in technologies and services could be replicated in public health sectors for better environmental outcomes. Partnerships between the two sectors are also suggested. But, some decades ago, when private health sector investments were not sufficient, the government health care investments and expenses played an essential role to provide their societies with efficient health services in Asia. Besides, one might claim that especially in the last decade, the private health sector, as well as the government health sector, follows an environmentally friendly efficient health management policy with recent medical technological products in Asia. Waste management has generally improved in Asian countries with some differences in effectiveness (Agamuthu et al. 2009; Shekdar 2009; Ngoc and Schnitzer 2009; Dahiya 2012; Rasul 2016) and might have played an important role in health management in Asia in general. The performance of the private health sector might be intrinsically linked to the structure and performance of the public health sector, which might suggest that deriving population benefit from the private health-care sector requires a regulatory response focused on the health-care sector as a whole (Morgan et al. 2016) . Multilateral organizations as the World Health Organization and the United Nations have emphasized public-private partnerships in healthcare sectors for this reason (UNECE 2012). Finally, one might claim that the further comparison of the environmental effects of health investments and management policies between government and private sector in Asia is of interest to search through some disaggregated microdata.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1135, "end": 1157, "text": "(Agamuthu et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1158, "end": 1171, "text": "Shekdar 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF141"}, {"start": 1172, "end": 1196, "text": "Ngoc and Schnitzer 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 1197, "end": 1209, "text": "Dahiya 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1210, "end": 1221, "text": "Rasul 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 1605, "end": 1625, "text": "(Morgan et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Further interpretations and discussions"}, {"text": "This research paper investigates the impact of health expenditures on CO 2 emissions in panel 36 Asian countries within the framework of the Environment Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. The panel sample period spans from 1991 to 2017. The paper, by employing FMOLS, GMM, and quantile regression methodologies, confirms the EKC in Asia.

On the other hand, the parameters from GMM highlight that only private health care expenditures contribute to lower carbon emissions. The difference in parameters obtained from two distinct methodologies was further investigated using the quantile regression method. Results revealed that there is a significant effect of both public and private health expenditures in lowering CO 2 emissions for the 50 th and 75 th quantiles; however, the effect is insignificant for the 25 th quantile. This shows that countries with a lower level of CO 2 emissions have a weak relation with health expenditures. This is worth considering finding as the effect of public and private health care expenditure on CO 2 emissions has not been studied for Asia by previous literature using the quantile regression method. Besides, this paper reached statistical evidence that both government sector and private health sector expenditures caused environmental pollution to decrease in Asia and that the negative impact of the private health sector on CO 2 emissions (in absolute value) is greater than that of the government health sector.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "According to the findings of the study, high government and private health expenditures increase environmental quality.

Besides the private sector's increasing volume of health (health care and capital) expenditures, the private sector could manage better the cost-utilization packages by considering environmentally friendly hospital management, hospital buildings, medical waste, and/or the electricity usage from renewable energy sources (like solar energy).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Policy implications"}, {"text": "Our study proposes the following policy recommendations: (a) electricity production from fossil fuels should be replaced with renewable sources.
