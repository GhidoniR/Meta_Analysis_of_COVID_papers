From the therapeutic perspective, IN drug administration is advantageous for treating CNS disorders, as demonstrated in multiple studies [35] . IN GCs delivery has recently been proven to control experimental neuroinflammation induced by systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection in an experimental model of sepsis [17] . In that report, IN delivery of DEX effectively reduced the percentage of the Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) brain cells that were increased by LPS, reduced the presence of neutrophils in the brain and decreased Interleukin-6 (IL) expression [17] . Interestingly, the protective anti-inflammatory effects were less pronounced when DEX was delivered at the same dose through the intra-venous (IV) route. Similar results have been observed in a 60-min middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke model. IN DEX reduced strikingly the ischemic brain tissue damage, reduced blood-brain barrier permeability, decreased mortality and improved the Neurological deficit (7-point neuroscore scale) and weight of animals [14] . Another study showed that intranasal administration of methylprednisolone to mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) suppressed the neuroinflammatory response and reduced immune cell infiltration and demyelination, in a similarly way to intravenous administration [36] .

Interestingly L/DEX treatment was associated with a significantly lower lung bacilli load on day 120 post-infection. Similar results have been found during early sepsis in mice, where L/DEX treatment significantly improved survival compared with control mice, while treatment with higher DEX concentrations did not. Besides, L/DEX significantly reduced bacteremia [38] . In recent years, it has been observed that GCs reinforce the innate immune system and repress the adaptive immune system to help resolve inflammation and restore homeostasis [39] . GCs induce the expression of Toll-Like Receptor 2 (TLR2), NOD-like receptors family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and the purinergic P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2R), all of these receptors participate in innate immunity [40] [41] [42] . The type of exposure to glucocorticoids and the basal state of the immune system are essential factors influencing the effects of GCs [10] . The innate immune system is fundamental for the initial immune response upon infection [43] , thus it could be possible that the decrease in lung bacilli lung in the murine model of TB is related to reinforcement of innate immunity mediated by L/DEX.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 654, "end": 658, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 835, "end": 839, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1069, "end": 1073, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1074, "end": 1078, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1079, "end": 1083, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1220, "end": 1224, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1314, "end": 1318, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "As we had observed that pulmonary infection by M. tb induced behavioral abnormalities [33] , we investigated the IN DEX administration effect on diverse behavioral abnormalities. Our results showed that the treatment with IN L/DEX and M/DEX decreased sickness behavior, induced an anxiolytic effect, reduced the depression-like behavior, produced a beneficial effect on the neurological outcome and improved the short and long term memory of the pulmonary infected TB mice. Active TB starts as a pulmonary exudative inflammatory process. Th1 lymphocytes mediate the protective adaptive immune response against TB with high production of IFN-\u03b3 and CD8+ T cytotoxic cells in animals and humans (Table 1 ) [44] . Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 might induce the development of depressive disorder by affecting neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal survival. These abnormal activities are produced by brain inflammation, which induces depression by diverse pathophysiological processes, such as disturbing monoaminergic neurotransmission, induce oxidative injury, and hippocampal neuronal damage. Indeed, DEX has been used to reduce inflammation in diverse neuroinflammatory conditions [14, 17] . Different studies demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids such as DEX were attributable to the reduced expression of IL1\u03b2, IL2, TGF\u03b2, and TNF\u03b1 [42] . Diverse evidence based on experimental studies demonstrated that GCs participate in the survival and death of neurons in both neurodegenerative and neuroprotective processes [43] . The binomial effect of GCs in the brain depends on the levels of GCs [43] . This coincides with our results, demonstrating that L/DEX and M/DEX effects on behavioral abnormalities are associated with a marked decrease in the inflammatory response. We found that mRNA expression levels of the inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1, IL12 and IFN\u03b3 were significantly downregulated in the treated group compared to the control non-treated TB group. It is known that low doses of GCs are more beneficial, preserving the physiological metabolism of the neurons and the HPA axis [43] . Interestingly, relatively low dose DEX administration (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection) has been shown to attenuate inflammation and decrease ED1-positive cells and three markers of inflammatory activation of microglia/macrophage in murine models of traumatic brain injury (TBI) [12, 45] . Similar results were found with hydrogel-mediated local delivery of dexamethasone that reduced neuroinflammation and improved functional motor recovery [46] .

In the second part of the work, we evaluated IN DEX administration's effect on sickness behavior, behavioral abnormalities, and immune response in different brain structures ( Figure 11 ). The selected areas of the brain (hypothalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum, frontal cortex) were immediately dissected by cutting with a razor blade, according to The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates [52] . The hippocampus was obtained underneath the frontal cortex, the cerebellum was identified as between the brainstem and the lateral recess of the 4th ventricle, the hypothalamus was obtained as the area lateral and medial to the fornix and the frontal cortex was obtained as the anterior part of the frontal lobes of the brain. Immediately after the dissection, the sample was frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen and used to quantify cytokines gene expression by RT-PCR. Different behavioral tests were performed during pulmonary TB. These tests included the study of sickness behavior (LMA.
