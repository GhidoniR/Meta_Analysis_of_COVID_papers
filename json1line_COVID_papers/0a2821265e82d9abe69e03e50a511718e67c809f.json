The total number of COVID-19 patients in the world and the total number of deaths due to coronavirus were announced as 1,279,010 and 72,603 respectively as of April 7, 2020 (Chow et al., 2020) . COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease and infects individuals through droplets when healthy individuals touch their mouth, nasal or ocular mucosa with their hands after coming into contact with the droplets spread from infected patients. The infectivity period of COVID-19 is not fully known but it starts 1 or 2 days before the onset of symptoms and ends when the symptoms disappear. When the cases in China were examined, it was observed that the incubation period for COVID-19 was on average 5 to 6 days (2-14 days) but could be up to 14 days in some cases (Lauer et al., 2020) . Therefore, necessary personal protective measures should be taken especially during the incubation period to prevent infection Lauer et al., 2020) . Various organizations including the WHO and the International Center for Disease Control and Prevention have made recommendations to prevent the continued spread of COVID-19 (Sohrabi et al.,2020; WHO, 2020c) . These recommendations include avoiding traveling to high-risk areas and not contacting people with coronavirus symptoms. They also recommend taking basic hygiene measures including personal protective measures such as washing hands frequently and wearing a mask (Sohrabi et al., 2020; WHO, 2020b) . In recent study found that gender significantly affects the level of health anxiety and the perception related to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic in that females had a higher level of health anxiety and perception related to controlling the pandemic (Ekiz et al., 2020) . A review of the literature, found females' levels of anxiety and risk perceptions to be consistently higher (Bandelow & Michaelis, 2015; \u00c7\u0131rako\u011flu, 2011; Leung et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2020b) . A separate study examined that the perceptions of the H1N1 influenza pandemic in Turkey and found that females considered the pandemic more communicable than males and females had a higher level of anxiety compared to males (\u00c7\u0131rako\u011flu, 2011) . The perception of the females in a study group on becoming infected was higher during the H1N1 influenza pandemic in Turkey (Akan et al., 2010) . A study highlights the gender affects the perception of risk and that females fear more than males (Raude & ve Setbon, 2009) . In another study that females have a higher level of fear of death in terms of becoming infected or the pandemic (Leung et al., 2005) . During swine flu at the relationship between gender and personal protective measures a study that males had a lower score in personal protective measures such as wearing a mask, washing their hands, and using a disinfectant (Jones & ve Salath\u00e9, 2009 ). This study found that the behaviors that the participants performed most were related to personal hygiene, social distancing, and hand washing. A study highlights individuals are highly sensitive to personal protective measures and participate in measures such as hand hygiene (Bostan et al., 2020) . During the swine flu 35% of individuals in countries such as England, Scotland, and Wales isolated themselves from crowded places, 28% washed their hands with water and soap more frequently, and 17% increased the frequency of disinfecting door handles (Rubin et al., 2009 ). In another recent study the most effective method to protect ourselves from the COVID-19 pandemic is to apply personal hygiene rules (Kwok et al., 2020) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 331, "end": 350, "text": "(Chow et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 915, "end": 935, "text": "(Lauer et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1065, "end": 1084, "text": "Lauer et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1261, "end": 1282, "text": "(Sohrabi et al.,2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1283, "end": 1294, "text": "WHO, 2020c)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1559, "end": 1581, "text": "(Sohrabi et al., 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1582, "end": 1593, "text": "WHO, 2020b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1848, "end": 1867, "text": "(Ekiz et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1978, "end": 2006, "text": "(Bandelow & Michaelis, 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2007, "end": 2023, "text": "\u00c7\u0131rako\u011flu, 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2024, "end": 2043, "text": "Leung et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2044, "end": 2063, "text": "Wang et al., 2020b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2290, "end": 2307, "text": "(\u00c7\u0131rako\u011flu, 2011)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2434, "end": 2453, "text": "(Akan et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2555, "end": 2580, "text": "(Raude & ve Setbon, 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2696, "end": 2716, "text": "(Leung et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2943, "end": 2968, "text": "(Jones & ve Salath\u00e9, 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3249, "end": 3270, "text": "(Bostan et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3525, "end": 3544, "text": "(Rubin et al., 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 3681, "end": 3700, "text": "(Kwok et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Studies on COVID-19 revealed that mortality and morbidity rates increase especially in patients \u226565 years of age (Desai, et al., 2020; Kebudi, 2020; Liang et al., 2020) .

A study conducted in China showed that 18 (1%) of 1590 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed with cancer (Liang et al., 2020) . The COVID-19 risk of patients who receive chemotherapy for cancer or surgical therapy is five times higher (Liang et al., 2020) . Patients who receive cancer treatment need intensive care more than other patients and their general condition worsens in a short time (13 days on avg.) (Liang et al., 2020) . A meta-analysis in China showed that 2% of all patients with COVID-19 were also diagnosed with cancer (Desai, et al., 2020) . In the United States of 5,688 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the Mount Sinai Hospital 334 (6%) were receiving chemotherapy. When the patients diagnosed with cancer were examined, those 66 to 80 years of age required intubation more frequently and their mortality rate increased at the same rate as well (Vickers, 2017) . A literature review revealed that individuals \u226565 years of age receiving chemotherapy or having a cancer history are considered a high-risk group for COVID-19 (Sohrabi et al., 2020) .

On March 21, 2020, a lockdown was declared for individuals 65 years and older adult without permission and except for obligatory cases. In literature reviews it show that there is insufficient information regarding COVID-19 pandemic awareness of the vulnerable group of geriatric patients with cancer and their access to the opportunities surrounding medical treatment and care.
