Although this concept can be defined variously, in general, it reflects \"the drive or ability to attribute mental states to another person/animal, and entails an appropriate affective response in the observer to the other person's mental state\" [1] . From a more detailed view, it is thought that empathy has two facets. Emotional empathy reflects an emotional reaction (e.g., joy) to the feelings of others [2] while cognitive empathy is \"cognitive and intellectual apprehension of another person's emotional state\" [3] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 328, "end": 331, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 491, "end": 494, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 600, "end": 603, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Empathy (both of its facets) is a key factor that allows successful social interaction [2] .

However, this capacity is not only related to successful social interchange, but it also provides important benefits for professions in which working with people is a central characteristic. For instance, it has been shown that a higher level of empathy of medical professionals is associated with higher satisfaction with health care [6] [7] [8] , with more frequent adherence to treatment [7] , or with lower complaints from patients [9] . The empathic abilities of medical professionals were also associated with lower anxiety [7] and distress in patients suffering from an oncological disease [8] . Moreover, empathy and associated concepts (such as compassion) seem to be linked with a lower probability of developing burnout in medical professionals [10, 11] .

Some years ago, the Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (TEQ) was developed [2] . This new self-report instrument measures primarily the emotional aspects of empathy. Compared to some already developed measures, the TEQ has the following advantages: (1) it reflects more contemporary theories of empathy as it does not assess aesthetic projection [16] or personal distress-which seems to be rather related to neurotic traits than to empathy [2] ; (2) it can be used in a wide range of research and practical contexts as it measures empathy towards people in general and not only to clinical practitioners or specific socio-cultural groups; (3) it is relatively brief and is thus more appropriate for use in larger test batteries. This unidimensional measure yields a high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha > 0. 85 ) and a high test-retest reliability (r = 0.87) [2] . Its validity was supported via positive correlation with the Empathy Quotient [1] (r = 0.80), the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test [17] (r = 0.35) and via negative correlation with the Autism Quotient [18] (r = \u22120.30) [2] .

However, in some measures that were psychometrically tested in the English language, in which NWIs were included, internal consistency was still relatively high, as well as factor loadings (FL) [2] .

Such an examination can have important theoretical implications. An inherent feature of some psychometric studies is that they are testing a hypothesis about the theoretically driven structure of an instrument. In this sense, they either support or weaken a theory about some phenomena. Applied to the context of this study, by evaluating psychometric parameters of the TEQ in the Czech cultural environment, the specific empathy theory (in terms of theoretical structure) can be tested. This might in turn increase the general understanding of the empathy construct as conceptualized by the authors of the TEQ. Examining the psychometric properties involved convergent and divergent validity testing. Convergent validity was assessed by an association of the TEQ with gender, social desirability, compassion, and spirituality. Divergent validity was evaluated by examining the link between the TEQ, neuroticism, and self-esteem.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Thus, the aim of this study was to: (i) examine the psychometric properties of the Czech version of the TEQ in the Czech environment; (ii) evaluate the psychometric parameters of negatively worded items on the internal consistency and factor loadings; (iii) evaluate psychometric properties of positively reformulated negative items; (iiii) examine temporal stability of the TEQ score.

It is therefore possible that in some participants, a lower language skill level could decrease the chance that they will understand and answer the items in the wrong way.

The second reason is that double negatives can be differently used in the Slavistics and in the English language environment (see [66, 67] ). More frequent use of double negatives in certain contexts by the native English speakersas compared to Czechs-can indicate that English language natives are more used to speaking with these double negatives, which might consequently decrease the cognitive language skill demand, while increasing the chance that they will be correctly understood.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 366, "end": 370, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 641, "end": 645, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1156, "end": 1160, "text": "[66,", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1161, "end": 1164, "text": "67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "General Discussion"}, {"text": "The strong positive relationship we found between empathy and compassion is in line with findings of studies that reported a strong [2, 16] to moderate [68, 69] correlation between these two constructs.
