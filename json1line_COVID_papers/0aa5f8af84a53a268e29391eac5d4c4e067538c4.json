However, there are other conditions that can simulate stroke, which are often referred to as stroke mimics. Awareness and understanding these stroke-like disorders are of extreme importance as the treatment of each of them might be variable. We hereby briefly discuss these stroke mimics, common differentials, and key features to differentiate amongst the various causes of acute neurological event. Stroke is one of the neurological emergencies that needs urgent intervention to prevent significant mortality and morbidity. At the same time, it is important to realize the importance of other conditions which may mimic to stroke. In this letter, we aim to discuss a few key features that could probably help to distinguish stroke from mimickers thereby helping emergency doctors, neurologists, and hospitalists in streamlining the correct treatment at the earliest.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Stroke mimics accounts for approximately 25% of probable stroke admissions. Marot et al have reported 368 clinical episodes of presumed stroke, among which 50% were actual vascular episodes. 1 In another retrospective study published in 2019, Garg et al reported 27.3% of stroke mimics. 2 Interestingly, in another prospective study, Matuja et al recruited 1403 patients; among those, 30.6% were presumed to have a stroke. Only 6.6% of these were identified to have stroke mimics. 3 Hospital-based studies could have higher reported numbers of stroke mimics as compared to community-based study probably due to 1. Selection bias of having sicker patients with more vascular risk factors. 4 2. Observation and reporting bias in having higher reporting of stroke-like episodes, including change in cognition, dropping of the eyelid, and limb weakness while being closely monitored. 1, 5, 6 Meanwhile, community-based studies would report a lesser number of stroke episodes because of possible loss of continuous recruitment of patients and decreased health-seeking behavior. While the actual rates of stroke mimics continue to be diverse, it is irrefutable that stroke mimics continue to be a significant challenge to the treating clinician. 7,8", "cite_spans": [{"start": 191, "end": 192, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 287, "end": 288, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 481, "end": 482, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 880, "end": 882, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 883, "end": 885, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 886, "end": 887, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Prevalence of Stroke Mimics (Community vs Health Care Settings)"}, {"text": "Computed tomography of the brain is routinely used in the assessment of stroke, as it facilitates the decision regarding the administration of thrombolytic agents. In the Marot et al's study, only 2 of the stroke mimics received IV rt-PA. 1 In the study by Garg et al, all 33 patients with stroke mimics received rt-PA as per the treatment protocol. 2 With the significant mortality benefit offered by rt-PA, the harm of not administering the same to a patient is higher. However, the modality of imaging could influence the unnecessary administration of thrombolytic agent to patients at low risk in terms of clinical presentation and vascular risk profile. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can not only show diffusion restriction but also identify granulomas, dilated Virchow robin spaces, cysts better, and differentiate them from a vascular event. Image 1 shows the MRI brain's findings of a 20-year-old female with headache and acute onset of aphasia who had an initial non-diagnostic CT but later diagnosed to be angioinvasive aspergillosis with the contributory clue from MRI (Figure 1 ). In a recent study by Matujia et al, improved rate of detection of mimics was secondary to better identification and differentiation of vascular events by MRI. In the absence of MRI, we agree that a detailed clinical history and examination would significantly influence the diagnosis of stroke in lowrisk patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 239, "end": 240, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 350, "end": 351, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1083, "end": 1092, "text": "(Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Calling a Stroke \"Stroke\""}, {"text": "In high-risk patients, the role of administration of rt-PA in stroke mimics has been studied as well.
