New approaches to prevent and treat anxiety and depression that are tailored to the concerns of this population are needed. A CF-specific internet-based cognitivebehavioral therapy (CBT) intervention was developed to increase access to evidence-based mental health care and decrease cost and burden of care for people with CF. Objective: To evaluate the usability and acceptability of \"eHealth CF-CBT,\" an internet-based program integrating therapist-guided online self-management modules with in-person or virtual sessions. Methods: Dutch adults with CF (N = 16) and CF health care providers (N = 16) systematically tested all sessions of the eHealth CF-CBT program, provided qualitative feedback, and completed measures including eHealth Impact Questionnaire (eHIQ), and System Usability Scale (SUS). Results: Patient and provider ratings of their overall impression of the eHealth CF-CBT program were high, with scores (mean; SD) of 8.3; 0.6 and 8.2; 0.8 respectively on a 10-point scale. Mean ratings of usability by patients (77.0/100) and providers (73.4/100) surpassed the SUS cut point for good favorability. Ratings (pooled mean; SD) on the assessed eHIQ domains Motivation and Confidence to Act (71.3; 10.0), Information and Presentation (78.9; 9.6), and Identification (62.0; 15.1) were positive, as were assessments of specific elements of session content and format. Conclusions: eHealth CF-CBT is the first therapist-guided internet-delivered CBT-based intervention for adults with CF. Initial evaluation with key stakeholders demonstrated high levels of acceptability and usability and provided input that was integrated to strengthen the program.

TIDES-CF, an epidemiological study of over 6000 individuals with CF, found elevated rates of depression and anxiety 2-3 times more common in individuals with CF than in the general population (Quittner et al., 2014) . Moreover, untreated depression and anxiety in people with CF were found to have negative consequences for health-related quality of life (HrQoL), adherence, medical outcomes and healthcare costs (Quittner et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2010; Verkleij et al., 2018) . Consequently, international mental health guidelines developed by the CF Foundation (CFF) and European CF Society (ECFS) recommend routine screening, treatment, and preventative efforts for depression and anxiety as a component of standard CF care (Abbott et al., 2019; Quittner et al., 2016) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 203, "end": 218, "text": "(Rayment, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 375, "end": 399, "text": "(Friedman et al., 2018a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 400, "end": 421, "text": "Sawicki et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 616, "end": 639, "text": "(Quittner et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 837, "end": 860, "text": "(Quittner et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 861, "end": 880, "text": "Smith et al., 2010;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 881, "end": 903, "text": "Verkleij et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1154, "end": 1175, "text": "(Abbott et al., 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1176, "end": 1198, "text": "Quittner et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "However, there are unique barriers related to health care burden and infection risk that may impede access to mental health care in this population. Individuals with CF face a high burden of medical treatment including a self-care regimen that averages between an hour to 2 h a day and frequent medical appointments. Hospitalizations lasting two weeks or more to treat exacerbations requiring IV antibiotics are common, and may be disruptive to regular outpatient mental health care (Mueller et al., 2020) . Even before the pandemic, individuals with CF have had to practice strict infection control due to vulnerability to infections leading to illness and reduction in lung functioning over time (Saiman et al., 2014) . Furthermore, infection control guidelines for individuals with CF recommend that individuals with CF avoid being in the same room and maintain 6 ft of distance from others with CF due to high risk associated with cross-infection (Saiman et al., 2014) . In addition, community-based mental health care providers may have little to no knowledge of CF, placing the burden on individuals with CF to educate their providers about the disease . For these reasons, there is increased burden and risk associated with mental health care appointments, and in-person group care models in CF are contraindicated. Individuals with CF may prefer and engage more fully in mental health care that is integrated into their routine CF care, delivered by mental health providers embedded within their care team, and may find integrated care that is available via telehealth or internet easier to access (Abbott et al., 2019; Quittner et al., 2020) .
