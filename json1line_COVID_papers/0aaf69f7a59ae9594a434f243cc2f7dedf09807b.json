Medical undergraduate education has been disrupted and transformed into prolonged home isolation and online learning. Although studies have reported that the COVID-19 pandemic tends to increase perceived stress (PS) and affect the mental health of medical students, the influencing factors are unclear. Therefore, based on the stress process model, this study will comprehensively evaluate the distribution of stressors of medical students and explore the personal and environmental predictors of PS during the epidemic. Participants and Methods: An online survey was conducted among medical students (n=369) from three medical universities in western China who engaged in online learning. A stress process conceptual framework was formed to explore the influencing factors of PS. The survey items contained four sections: (a) the potential stressors derived from academic, psychosocial and health-related demands; coping resources such as (b) online learning environment support and (c) personal resilience, including online learning behavior and individual characteristics; and (d) PS, perception of imbalanced demands and coping resources. Results: The mean PS score was 17.39 (SD=4.58), and over four-fifths (82.3%) of the students had moderate to high levels of stress. The average item scores of academic, psychosocial and health-related stressors were 2.72 (SD=0.55), 2.31 (SD=0.55) and 2.07 (SD=0.50), respectively. Gender, grade, psychosocial stressors, health-related stressors, specific online learning behavior (persistence, attitude and flexibility), and the online learning environment (teaching, social and cognitive presence) were predictors of PS. Conclusion: Our results specify that a reduction in psychological and health-related stressor stimulation, specific online learning behavior promotion, and well-established online learning environment support could be considered essential for alleviating the negative impacts of COVID-19 on the psychosocial health of medical undergraduates.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Due to the global COVID-19 outbreak, undergraduate students from Chinese universities were quarantined at home, face-to-face teaching has been suspended since late February, and courses have moved entirely online according to the requirements of the Ministry of Education (MOE). 1 Because of their strong selfawareness of hygienic habits, social isolation and professional courses, medical students were more vulnerable to the negative effects of these public health emergencies and showed higher levels of perceived stress (PS) compared to the general learning period. 2 PS is defined as a condition or feeling experienced when a person perceives that the demands exceed the personal and coping resources the individual can mobilize. 3 Facing extreme changes in study habits and living styles, the current PS among medical students could therefore be understood as an imbalance between their living and online learning needs during the COVID-19 pandemic and the existing social support and resources of individuals' capabilities to respond. 4 The modified stress model conducted for medical students identified the direct effects of personal resources (eg optimism, resilient coping, etc.) on perceived stress and indirect effects on stress reactions (eg depression, anxiety, etc.). 5 Serval studies also revealed that prolonged periods of high levels of PS strongly affect mental health and also have unfavorable effects on academic performance. [5] [6] [7] [8] In the absence of COVID-19, given the strikingly higher proportion of stress among undergraduate medical students compared to the age-matched general population and students in other academic fields, Western and Asian studies have assessed PS and explored the potential stressors for improving students' stress and mental health. 9, 10 Generally, medical students' main stressors can be classified into three groups: academic pressure, psychosocial issues and health-related stressors. 11, 12 In other words, these sources of stress could be considered to be the students' unmet needs from learning, psychosocial and healthy aspects. 13 Although interventions have been developed based on the identified stressors, the leading stressors also vary across cultural backgrounds and learning environments. 14, 15 A large sampled survey across 12 nations found that parental expectations as a key stressor among medical students from India. 15 Financial instability in the family would be more likely reported as a stressor in high-income group countries, such as Portugal, Italy and Poland, while performance in examinations was the main stressor in Chinese students. 15, 16 Before the COVID-19 pandemic, online learning has been growing steadily worldwide over the past 20 years resulting in a significant change in the academic environment and the experience of stress among students. 17 Keeping up with information is one of the most cited stressors in online education. Online educators and learners need to be available any time of the day via mobile phones and/or electronic mail. 18 Furthermore, the students are exposed to unique stressors, such as the diversity in using social media and acceptance of ever-changing technology to enable flexible learning, independent learning, and participation in online communities. 19, 20 Therefore, it is necessary to include the influence of cultures and social backgrounds on the PS of the target student group in future studies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 279, "end": 280, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 570, "end": 571, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 735, "end": 736, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1042, "end": 1043, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1284, "end": 1285, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1448, "end": 1451, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1452, "end": 1455, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1456, "end": 1459, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1460, "end": 1463, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1794, "end": 1796, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1797, "end": 1799, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1950, "end": 1953, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1954, "end": 1956, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2098, "end": 2100, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2266, "end": 2269, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2270, "end": 2272, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2400, "end": 2402, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2628, "end": 2631, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2632, "end": 2634, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2847, "end": 2849, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3047, "end": 3049, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3288, "end": 3291, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3292, "end": 3294, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic represents the most universal shared stressor threatening health, is more serious, and may indirectly increase students' PS through the negative effects on learning behavior, attitude and online education. 21 A review showed that the intense shift to online learning during the outbreak may lead to increased PS because of increased on-screen time. 22 A study in Saudi Arabia stated that long-term COVID-19 quarantine may cause 56.2% of all medical students to decrease the time they spend studying. 23 Medical students with a higher level of severe stress were reported to prefer face-to-face classes rather than the current online learning and have trouble with time management. 24 Learning environmental barriers to online education, such as the absence of practice and inadequate online learning material, contribute to students' stressed emotions. 25 It is worth noting that both developed and developing countries faced an enormous challenge, due to the unprecedented circumstances of COVID-19 and conversion from lectures or tutorials to online learning. 26 Medical students (29.8%) from Japan reported concerns about the shift toward online education, as they thought online education could have been ineffective compared with in-person learning. 27 More than half of medical students (56.3%) from Libya disagreed that online learning better than traditional teaching methods during the COVID-19 pandemic. 28 Although China plans to emphasized the building of online education by 2025, according to a document jointly issued by the MOE which proposed the nationwide construction of first-class online medical courses, to ensure that online education resources are accessible to all students. 29 Recent literature has also pointed to 30% of Chinese medical students had no prior learning experiences with most of the online learning modes and 64.97% were low satisfaction with the ongoing online education as the support and service of platforms to be insufficient. 30 In front of a sudden outbreak of the disease, however, might be too fast to create a proper online learning environment without a specific theoretical framework for meeting learning needs. The Community of Inquiry framework (CoI) provides the basis for creating a learner-centered environment for online education, and the framework includes three core components that have been confirmed as considerable predictors of meeting students' learning experience and optimizing their academic performance in higher online medical education: teaching presence, social presence and cognitive presence. 32, 33 Since then, the CoI instrument has gradually developed based on the CoI framework and has been widely used to measure the online learning environment. 33 However, compared with assessments the completion of the online learning program, the medical students' needs and perception of the online learning environment have received less attention during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Therefore, understanding the potential stressors and risk factors for PS to alleviate the negative impacts of public health emergencies on medical students to obtain candidate targets for preventive strategies will be very significant. This study hypothesized a conceptual framework ( Figure 1 ) in which there is a change in terms of stressors among medical students before and after the full-scale switch to online learning due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the amount of PS is associated with individual characteristics, behaviors and online learning environments. PS occurs when stressors (ie demands) go up, and resources (ie supports) go down, that is, demands overload. To verify the hypothesis, the present study sought (1) to investigate the level and sources of the stress experienced by Chinese undergraduate medical students due to online learning and (2) to identify the predictors related to why undergraduate medical students do not receive the necessary support. Focusing on the stressors and risk factors of PS among medical students in such a pandemic period is indispensable before developing adapted and targeted interventions to maintain good mental health.

For instance, studies revealed that dental and nursing students experienced higher PS due to early practice stage. 10, 50 The present study comprehensively investigated the Chinese subpopulation from a total of 29 stressors classified as academic, psychosocial and health-related demands. Specifically, the top two stressors were \"performance in examinations\" from the academic area and \"worry about the future\" from the psychosocial area. This result seemed consistent with another Chinese study that noted that the strongest stressor among Chinese dental students was \"performance pressure\", specifically, fear of examinations, competition with peers, and uncertainty about the future. 51 This result suggested that \"academic performance\" and \"career expectations\" may be sustained demands or challenges among Chinese medical school students. In addition, health-related stressors were also proposed by our participants.

Also, females in medicine are more likely to experience different expectations, pressures, obstacles, and harassment in the process of developing the capacity to gain scientific excellence and gender equality-related management positions. 57 Besides, a previous study revealed that females perceived higher stress was due to the differences in neuroendocrine and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity. 58 Gender as a predictor of PS that could not be underestimated, thus, special consideration to female students was needed. In agreement with other literature on preclinical students, 47 this study revealed that junior-year students experienced higher stress than seniors. The junior-year students mainly engaged in basic medical courses such as gross anatomy during the pandemic. They experienced higher pressure may be due to the maladjustments to online learning of basic medical practical courses such as gross anatomy in quarantine and more worry about the final examination. 59 In addition, lower levels of professional knowledge, skills and the absence of a learning strategy of junior-year students could be one explanation of this finding. 60 This suggested that adequate resources such as coping strategies, resilience and learning environment supports were considerable to support junior-year students.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 268, "end": 271, "text": "54,", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 272, "end": 274, "text": "55", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 414, "end": 417, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 418, "end": 420, "text": "56", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 821, "end": 823, "text": "57", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 999, "end": 1001, "text": "58", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1183, "end": 1185, "text": "47", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1580, "end": 1582, "text": "59", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1748, "end": 1750, "text": "60", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Predictors of Perceived Stress"}, {"text": "The studies before the COVID-19 pandemic reported that academic stressor was the significant predictor of PS among medical students, which contradicts the finding in this study. 61, 62 In the current study, there seemed to be few significant associations between academic-related stressors and PS, instead, the greater the exposure to social-related stressors and health-related stressors, the greater the perceived stress. For instance, medical students who were concerned about \"high parental expectations\", \"worry about the future\", \"lack of entertainment\", \"sleeping difficulties\", \"COVID-19 prevention and control situation of the country\", etc. might experience high stress levels. Different from a previous study conducted at a university, the participants in this study have been learning at home and quarantining together with their parents for nearly four months; furthermore, they might frequently perceive that their parents strongly expect them to gain a prestigious career in line with Asian cultural values, which contributes to negative long-term effects. 63, 64 Moreover, the strict isolation in Chongqing, China led to a lack of entertainment and irregular daily routines, and medical students expressed an urgent desire to return to normal school life and tended to pay special attention to the control of the coronavirus, which showed a positive association with PS, in line with a study of nursing students in Turkey. 47 Comparing the pre-epidemic literature, the results of this study suggested that the COVID-19 crisis did affect the distribution of stressors among medical students.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 178, "end": 181, "text": "61,", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 182, "end": 184, "text": "62", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1072, "end": 1075, "text": "63,", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1076, "end": 1078, "text": "64", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1439, "end": 1441, "text": "47", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Predictors of Perceived Stress"}, {"text": "The pandemic has accelerated the inevitable implementation of online learning in medical education. Online learning behavior and the online learning environment might be the critical internal and external associated factors of PS among medical students. 24, 25 Consistent with the perspective from Puljak et al, this result of the regression model revealed a significant correlation between the online learning environment and PS. 25 Among the online learning environments, teaching presence and social presence were negative predictors of PS. Namely, if the instructor provided a trusting environment to communicate in and clear instructions on how to participate in subject learning activities, the students might be satisfied with the learning activity and experience less PS. Besides, the better social presence of online learning represents more cooperative and interactive learning environment. It helped students to develop interpersonal relationships and active learning patterns, which could alleviate the mental distress of students. 65 Cognitive presence was, however, a positive predictor of PS. That is, if the course starts with more exploratory learning activities, such as brainstorming or online discussions to develop solutions to subject problems that can be applied in practice, PS will be increased among Chinese medical students. This finding agreed with a study conducted by Katernyak et al. 66 Besides, this study identified that some dimensions of online learning behavior, such as worse persistence, attitude and flexibility of students, contributed to increased PS. For instance, being unable to \"concentrate on actively learning, solve problems over the internet and transfer new technology for learning\" were more likely to be risk factors for PS.

Furthermore, compared with other stress scales that focus on learning issues and the lack of the inclusion of individual life issues, the PSS-10 does not link an assessment to a specific situation and covers situations in students' lives that are regarded as stressful and as their reactions. In addition, PS was measured relatively reliable through self-reported real feelings in the past month when the epidemic was smoothly controlled and online learning was stable and not based on the discretion of simple symptoms and stress at a certain time.

Meanwhile, due to the lack of probability sampling and moderate response rates (53.31%), the existence of some selection or nonresponse bias is yet another limitation.
