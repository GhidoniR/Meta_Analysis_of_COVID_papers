In this subset of patients, the amount of fluid infused over the 2 days before the lowest value of uric acid was minimal, with a median [IQR] positive fluid balance of 186 ml per day [\u2212 58, 1050]. The absence of any significant impact from excessive volume resuscitation on serum uric acid levels is also supported by (i) a decrease in serum uric acid levels already upon admission, as compared with baseline values obtained for a large subset (n = 122) of patients; (ii) plasma sodium concentration and serum osmolality in the normal range, with a median of 139 mmol/l [137-142] and 286 mOsm/kg [283-301], respectively, at the time of the lowest level of uric acid recorded during hospitalization.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 649, "end": 652, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 653, "end": 656, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 657, "end": 660, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 661, "end": 664, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 665, "end": 668, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 669, "end": 673, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 799, "end": 802, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 803, "end": 806, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 807, "end": 810, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 811, "end": 814, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 815, "end": 818, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 819, "end": 822, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 860, "end": 863, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 864, "end": 867, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 868, "end": 871, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 872, "end": 875, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 876, "end": 879, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 880, "end": 883, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 884, "end": 888, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 889, "end": 893, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 994, "end": 997, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 998, "end": 1001, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1002, "end": 1005, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1006, "end": 1009, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1010, "end": 1013, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 543, "end": 551, "text": "Fig. S2A", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 935, "end": 943, "text": "Fig. S2B", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1181, "end": 1189, "text": "Fig. S2A", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Low serum levels of uric acid associate with disease severity and outcome in COVID-19"}, {"text": "Survival analyses using Kaplan-Meier estimates showed reduced mechanical ventilation-free survival among patients with versus those without hypouricemia (log-rank, P < 0.001) ( Fig. 3d; Table 3 ).

Thorough assessment of the kinetics of serum uric acid levels showed an acute and reversible decrease that parallels the development of respiratory failure. The occurrence of hypouricemia was independent from drugs interfering with uric acid production, nephrotoxic medications, treatment received for COVID-19 or viral load, but was associated with defective tubular handling of uric acid and pathological features suggestive of an altered expression of urate transporter in the kidney proximal tubule. The prevalence of hypouricemia is approximately 0.3% in the general ambulatory population and ranges between 1.2% and 2.5% among hospitalized patients [15, 16] . In our study, 20% of the patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection developed hypouricemia, a proportion that increased to 77% among patients requiring mechanical ventilation. The association between hypouricemia and progression to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation was independent from age, gender, comorbidities and biological parameters of disease severity, suggesting its potential use as a biomarker to identify patients at risk of more severe COVID-19. The high prevalence of hypouricemia in COVID-19 patients is reminiscent of that observed during the 2003 outbreak of SARS, where ~ 25% of patients with SARS-CoV infection developed hypouricemia, with higher rates in patients requiring mechanical ventilation [10] . These findings are also in line with recent data from retrospective cohorts of Chinese patients with COVID-19, in whom low serum levels of uric acid were associated with more severe symptoms [17] [18] [19] and with an increased risk of death [19] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 884, "end": 888, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 889, "end": 892, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1635, "end": 1639, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1833, "end": 1837, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1838, "end": 1842, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1843, "end": 1847, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1884, "end": 1888, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Uric acid is the end-product of purine metabolism in humans, who lack uricase, and is generated in the liver, a process catalyzed by xanthine oxidase. The kidney is an important regulator of circulating uric acid levels as it excretes most of total body uric acid [20] . Serum urate is freely filtered by the glomeruli followed by a complex balance of reabsorption and secretion in the kidney proximal tubule. Although the molecular mechanisms of urate transport in the proximal tubule are still incompletely understood, URAT1 (SLC22A12) is the main apical transporter mediating urate reabsorption in the brush border of the proximal tubule [21] . Its major role was further supported by the strong association between SLC22A12 gene variants and serum uric acid levels in the general population [22] . Defective tubular handling of urate contributes to the development of hypouricemia in patients with life-threatening COVID-19, a mechanism that is supported by the presence of inappropriate uricosuria and by the association with other features of proximal tubule dysfunction [8] . In a small subset of kidney samples from patients who died from COVID-19, we showed that life-threatening SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a significant (~ 70%) decrease in the expression of the apical urate transporter URAT1 in the kidney proximal tubule, contributing to the impaired tubular absorption of urate. Of note, experimental data showed that acute inflammation elicited by viral mimetics in rats downregulates the expression of kidney tubule transporters, including URAT1 [23] . Upstream mechanisms linking viral infection and downregulation of proximal tubule transporters remain to be elucidated, but may involve either direct viral cytotoxic effects on the proximal tubule and/or indirect effects resulting from pro-inflammatory cytokines [24] . Although we found no association with the use of urate lowering drugs or severe liver disease, we cannot formally rule out that impaired uric acid generation, i.e., through reduced dietary intake, may have contributed to aggravate hypouricemia among the sickest patients. We also found no evidence for the presence of the syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 and hypouricemia, nor for any massive fluid infusion potentially causing fluid overload and hemodilution.

Second, uric acid was found to act as an endogenous modulator of innate immunity, and it is tempting to speculate that low levels of serum uric acid may therefore exacerbate the cytokine storm observed during COVID-19 [26, 27] . Third, recent evidence demonstrated that acute and severe hypouricemia induced in healthy individuals causes endothelial dysfunction, reduces blood pressure, decreases myeloperoxidase activity and increases lipid peroxidation [28] . Lastly, as proximal tubule cells and pneumocytes both express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cellular receptor mediating viral entry into host cells, we cannot rule out a parallel evolution at the tubular and lung level, resulting from putative direct cellular infection by SARS-CoV-2 in both organs [8] .
