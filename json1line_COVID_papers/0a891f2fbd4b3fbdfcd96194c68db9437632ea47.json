Beginning with the 12-week interval May 6 -July 28, there was a stable surplus of hospital admissions in 2020. Standardized incidence rates of admissions during this surplus period (May 6 -December 15, 2020) are summarized in Table 1. Adjustment for age, sex and SARS-CoV-2 infection, made no significant difference to the direction or magnitude of the relative increase in admissions. Admissions were more frequent among those with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In patients with a pulmonary embolism as primary diagnosis excluding 45 SARS-CoV-2 cases (1.8 %), age during the 2020 surplus was similar (69.0 \u00b115.3 vs. 68.4 \u00b115.4 years, P=0.11) when compared to a corresponding control period in 2016 -2019, however, with more octogenarians (30.1 vs 26.5%, P< 0.01). There was an observable, but non-significant change in sex distribution with more males in 2020 than in 2016 -2019 (51.2 vs. 49.1%, P=0.07). While overall comorbidities expressed as weighted AHRQ Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (14.1 \u00b1 10.1 vs. 13.9 \u00b110.3, P=0.28), the presence of thrombosis (46.1 vs 45.4%, P=0.55) and surgery (3.8 vs. 4.3%, P=0.33) were comparable, coagulopathy (3.3 vs 4.5%, P=0.01) and metastatic cancer (3.0 vs 4.0%, P=0.03) as contributing factors were less frequently observed during the 2020 surplus. Interventional treatments (thrombolytic therapy, thrombectomy or inferior vena cava filter placement) were less frequently used (4.7 vs 6.6%, OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58 \u2212 0.89, P< 0.01) which was mainly driven by thrombolytic therapy (4.7 vs 6.4%, OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.60 \u2212 0.91, P< 0.01). Similarly, intensive care (35.1 vs 38.8%, OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75 \u2212 0.92, P< 0.01) and mechanical ventilation utilization (7.2 vs 8.1%, OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 -1.04, P=0.14) as well as in-hospital-mortality rates (7.8 vs 9.8%, OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.64 \u2212 0.90, P< 0.01) were lower in 2020 compared with 2016 -2019. This was associated with a shorter length of hospital stay (6.4 \u00b15.4 vs. 7.2 \u00b15.7 days, P< 0.01) during the 2020 surplus period.

Crude rates for admissions and treatments were calculated by dividing the number of cumulative events by the number of days for each time period. Crude-rate ratios or odds ratios (OR) were calculated using Poisson mixed regression to model the number of hospitalizations and logistic mixed regression to model the proportions of treatments per period specifying hospitals as random factor, respectively. To identify admission trends over time, rolling crude-rate ratios were calculated for 12-week intervals with 11-week overlap resulting in one ratio every week. For the analysis of relative risk (RR), we used Poisson regression und calculated incidence rates with respect to the underlying population of inpatient cases. Patient characteristics were compared with ANOVA for numerical and Chi2 test for categorical variables.
