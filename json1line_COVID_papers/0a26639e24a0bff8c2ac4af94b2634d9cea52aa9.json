Potentially, these procedures may be useful in COVID-19 treatment. The NO level in complexes with hemoglobin in blood decreases as the gNO concentration in the gas flow produced by the Plazon system increases from 100 to 2100 ppm, so that at 2000 ppm more than one-half of the gas can be incorporated into dinitrosyl complexes formed in tissues of the lungs and respiratory tract. Thus, the effect of gNO inhalation may be similar to that observed after administration of solutions of dinitrosyl iron complexes, namely, to the presence of dinitrosyl iron complexes with thiol-containing ligands in lung and airway tissues. With regard to the hypothesis posited earlier that these complexes can suppress coronavirus replication as donors of nitrosonium cations (Biophysics 65, 818, 2020), it is not inconceivable that administration of gNO or chemically synthesized dinitrosyl iron complexes with thiol-containing ligands may help treat COVID-19. In tests on the authors of this paper as volunteers, the tolerance concentration of gNO inhaled within 15 min was approximately 2000 ppm.

In this regard, two questions arise: (1) why were NO molecules that entered the lungs retained in their tissue and, apparently in the respiratory tissues without entering the blood, where they could be trapped by hemoglobin molecules?

Hence, NO incorporation in these complexes could cause the NO retention in lung and respiratory tissues of human participants inhaling this agent. Experiments described in [45] revealed a significant increase in the level of loosely bound (soluble) iron with a decrease in oxygen concentration in animal cell culture medium, that is, under hypoxic conditions, which brought about a drastic increase in the level of DNICs with thiol-containing ligands formed in the reaction of NO and thiols with soluble iron. We may deduce from those observations that the increase in NO retention in lung and respiratory tissues with increase in the dose of NO inhaled by volunteers in our experiments might be related to (1) higher DNIC levels in these tissues, in accordance with the mass-action law and (2) the increasing level of soluble iron.
