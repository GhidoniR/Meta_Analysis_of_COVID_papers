A clone was defined by at least 2 cells sharing the same CDR3 amino acid sequence, either from TCRa, TCRb or the combination of both. The 10 most expanded clones were primarily identified in the cytotoxic CD4 + T-cell subset and to a lesser extent in the Humanin + CD4 + T-cell subset in ACPA+ RA SF (Fig. 5a, right panel and supplementaryTable 3and 4). Some of the expanded clones were shared between PB and SF(Fig. 5a, left panel). These 10 expanded T-cell clones were originating from 4 RA patients (SupplementaryFigure 9) of which three identical clones were identified between patient 5 and 6. The analysis of synovial fluid T-cell clones composed of at least 4 cells in each patient revealed that they mainly originate from cytotoxic CD4 + T cells, CXCL13 + TPH and to a lesser extent PRDM1 + TPH and Humanin CD4 + T cells (Fig. 5b, supplementary", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "fluid from ACPA-(n=9) and ACPA+ (n=12) RA patients were collected at the Rheumatology Clinic of Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm (Supplementary Table 1).
