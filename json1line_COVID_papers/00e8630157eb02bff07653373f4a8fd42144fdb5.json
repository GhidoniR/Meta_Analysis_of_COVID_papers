Our results indicate that virtual patients with low production rates of 41 infected cell derived IFN subsequently experienced highly inflammatory disease phenotypes, compared 42 to those with early and robust IFN responses. In these in silico patients, the maximum concentration of 43 IL-6 was also a major predictor of CD8 + T cell depletion. Our analyses predicted that individuals with 44 severe COVID-19 also have accelerated monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation that was mediated by 45 increased IL-6 and reduced type I IFN signalling. Together, these findings identify biomarkers driving 46 the development of severe COVID-19 and support early interventions aimed at reducing inflammation. 47 Author summary 48 Understanding of how the immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 infections is critical for 49 improving diagnostic and treatment approaches. Identifying which immune mechanisms lead to 50 divergent outcomes can be clinically difficult, and experimental models and longitudinal data are only 51 beginning to emerge. In response, we developed a mechanistic, mathematical and computational model 52 of the immunopathology of COVID-19 calibrated to and validated against a broad set of experimental 53 and clinical immunological data. To study the drivers of severe COVID-19, we used our model to 54 expand a cohort of virtual patients, each with realistic disease dynamics. Our results identify key 55 processes that regulate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in virtual patients and suggest 56 viable therapeutic targets, underlining the importance of a rational approach to studying novel 57 pathogens using intra-host models. 58 65 immunopathology as specific presentations in severe COVID-19 [2-6]. An over-exuberant innate 66 immune response with larger numbers of infiltrating neutrophils [7,8] arrests the adaptive immune 67 response through the excessive release of reactive oxygen species that leads to extensive tissue damage 68 and depletion of epithelial cells [9]. In addition, lymphopenia, in particular, is one of the most 69 prominent markers of COVID-19 and has been observed in over 80% of patients [6, 10-12]. However, 70 the immune mechanisms that lead to disparate outcomes during SARS-CoV-2 infection remain to be 71 delineated. 72 Cytokines are critically important for controlling virus infections [13, 14] and are central to the 73 pathophysiology of COVID-19, sometimes playing a detrimental role in the context of a cytokine storm 74 . : bioRxiv preprint [10]. For example, interleukin-6 (IL-6) can stimulate CD8 + T cell expansion under inflammatory 75 conditions [15]; however, in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients with lymphopenia, IL-6 has been 76 shown to be elevated [16] without an increase in CD8 + T cell counts [17]. Type I interferons (such as 77 IFNs-\u03b1, \u03b2 [18]) also play a major role in limiting viral replication by inducing a refractory state in 78 susceptible and infected cells [19-21]. Due to this, it has been suggested that a delay in mounting an 79 effective IFN response may be responsible for COVID-19 severity [22] as it is for other highly 80 pathogenic coronavirus (i.e. SARS-CoV and MERS) infections [13]. Overall, patients with severe 81 COVID-19 present with lymphopenia [14, 23], and are likely to have increased inflammatory cytokines 82 such as IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and granulocyte colony-83 stimulating factor (G-CSF) [7, 17, 24]. 84 Because identifying which immune mechanisms lead to divergent outcomes can be difficult 85 clinically, and experimental models and longitudinal data are only beginning to emerge, theoretical 86 explorations are ideal [25]. Quantitative approaches combining mechanistic disease modelling and 87 computational strategies are being increasingly leveraged to investigate inter-and intra-patient 88 variability by, for example, developing virtual clinical trials [26-28]. More recently, viral dynamics 89 models [29, 30] have been applied to understand SARS-CoV-2 within-host dynamics and their 90 implications for therapy [31-36]. However, there are few comprehensive models that integrate detailed 91 immune mechanisms and allow interrogation of the dynamics controlling divergent outcomes, and 92 none have attempted to quantify the high degree of variability in patient responses to SARS-CoV-2 93 through modelling.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "In this study, we developed a mechanistic mathematical model to describe the within host 95 immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

In the severe disease 331 simulation, viral load was cleared marginally faster (~1 day) in comparison to the mild disease 332 simulation. This finding is supported by recent clinical evidence showing that an increased rate of viral 333 decline rather than peak viral load may be more predictive of disease severity [6]. This therefore 334 suggests that viral load may not be a necessary attribute to obtain severe tissue damage. Instead, our 335 model predicts that increases in tissue damage occur through heightened innate immune responses.336 Evaluating SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of 200 virtual patients revealed several immunological 337 responses responsible for differential disease presentation. Notably, a distinct, emergent switch in the 338 type I IFN response corresponded with late IFN peaks and more severe disease (i.e., higher 339 inflammation Y). This supports previous findings that connect a delay in type I IFN with more severe 340 presentations of highly pathogenic coronaviruses infections including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and 341 SARS-CoV-2 [13, 14, 22]. Virtual patients with rates of monocyte differentiation close to the rate at 342 homeostasis tended to achieve peak IFN concentrations approximately 2 days after infection compared 343 to those with higher inflammation and later IFN responses, who had at least a 3-fold increase in this 344 rate. This switch in timing was caused by increased rates of monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation 345 and decreased production of IFN by infected cells, with the initial delay of IFN caused by increased 346 monocyte differentiation and the more extreme IFN delays caused by IFN production from infected 347 cells, indicating that the timing of the IFN peak in a patient may allow for improved stratification into 348 treatment arms designed to target one or both of these responses. The finding that IFN binding was 349 predictive of the duration of lung tissue damage, suggests that virus-intrinsic properties and their ability 350 to inhibit receptor mediated binding and endocytosis could delay IFN production and cause 351 downstream increases in IL-6 and GM-CSF resulting in severe disease.
