This review summarizes the history, past achievements and future directions of the GeoSentinel Network. Key findings: Funded by the US CDC in 1996, GeoSentinel has grown from a group of eight US-based travel and tropical medicine centers to a global network, which currently consists of 68 sites in 28 countries. GeoSentinel has provided important contributions that have enhanced the ability to use destination-specific differences to guide diagnosis and treatment of returning travelers, migrants and refugees. During the last two decades, GeoSentinel has identified a number of sentinel infectious disease events including previously unrecognized outbreaks and occurrence of diseases in locations thought not to harbor certain infectious agents. GeoSentinel has also provided useful insight into illnesses affecting different traveling populations such as migrants, business travelers and students, while characterizing in greater detail the epidemiology of infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, leishmaniasis and Zika virus disease. Conclusions: Surveillance of travel-and migration-related infectious diseases has been the main focus of GeoSentinel for the last 25 years. However, GeoSentinel is now evolving into a network that will conduct both research and surveillance.

GeoSentinel was designed to track emerging infectious diseases at their point of entry into domestic populations, monitor global trends in disease occurrence among travelers, and respond to urgent public health queries. The network was also developed to aid in rapid response by electronically disseminating alerts to surveillance sites, to all ISTM members worldwide and to partner organizations globally. The vision of the then ISTM President Jay Keystone led to the ISTM providing 50 000 USD seed money to develop the network until independent funding could be secured. By May 1996 GeoSentinel was awarded competitive funding through the CDC Division of Quarantine (Table 1) , under a US initiative to strengthen surveillance and response to emerging pathogens as strongly suggested by the Institute of Medicine in their 1992 report. By the end of 1997, GeoSentinel went 'live' at participating surveillance sites using a set of data fields that linked destination, date of travel and disease diagnosis in returning travelers. GeoSentinel was expanded internationally and data from all sites were manually aggregated at an Atlanta data center. In 1998, the group began to host annual Site Directors meetings at different locations around the world which brought together the combined expertise and intellect of many of the key leaders in the field of travel medicine and which continue as an epicenter for the development and advancement of research in the field.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 938, "end": 947, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "GeoSentinel-the early years (1995-2013)"}, {"text": "In 2020, instantaneous global sharing of information around disease outbreaks is taken for granted.

However, in September 2000, GeoSentinel, which by then had expanded to 26 sites on all continents, provided one of the first demonstrations of the beginning of the exciting adventure in the way global surveillance data can rapidly be turned into information for action. The Borneo Eco-Challenge leptospirosis outbreak 15 ,16 demonstrated that the growth of partnerships between ISTM, CDC, and other medical societies, governments and private organizations had become one of the surveillance network's greatest assets.

Returning travelers and migrants seen at GeoSentinel sites serve as sentinels-they provide a sample of disease agents that may be acquired in 249 countries and territories. Data reported by the sentinel Sites are entered online into a secure central database ( Figure 1 ).

The GeoSentinel network remains uniquely valuable as a platform for understanding the emergence and movement of infectious diseases around the globe. It is first and foremost a network of people, bringing together many of the world's recognized experts in travel and tropical health. These experts are backed by the resources of their associated academic institutions, which include the material resources for diagnosing and characterizing both common and esoteric infections, and the scholarly resources for driving new project development and success. The network has access to laboratory expertise in every relevant discipline, renowned researchers in epidemiology and clinical sciences, and globally recognized expert clinicians who provide the interface with ill travelers. Finally, the network has a truly worldwide catchment, with sites across world providing care to large numbers of travelers of every type returning from every region of the globe. In recent years, it has become apparent that the network needed to move beyond sentinel surveillance and retrospective review of surveillance data. Over the past 25 years, communication networks for transmitting surveillance information have multiplied in nature and speed, diluting GeoSentinel's unique advantages in this regard. Many of the analyses of the database concentrated on 'who gets what where' questions, both broadly speaking as well as focused on specific illnesses and syndromes. As described above, some of these larger analyses provided for the first time a detailed understanding of the epidemiology of imported infections, replacing information which had previous been gleaned from single center reviews, or small collaborations. 13,17 It has also become evident that the basic epidemiology of many of the illnesses investigated is not changing in the shortterm, and that broadening the scope of GeoSentinel's mission would be important for future discoveries.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Future directions"}, {"text": "The first step forward was the development of the enhanced surveillance projects described above.

Antibiotic susceptibility surveillance will also remain important. In the future, more sophisticated technology will be added to assist in interpreting data, and techniques using machine learning are likely to improve the ability to signal sentinel eventsinfections emerging in unexpected locations, unusual clusters and unanticipated trends-all signals which can trigger a more focused investigation. The next step in understanding imported infections will necessarily involve developing a more traditional research-based approach including the use of molecular epidemiology. Even simple modifications of the existing enhanced surveillance model with the addition of questionnaires, more detailed clinical outcomes data, and project driven collection of biologic samples greatly expands the potential for advances in the field.
