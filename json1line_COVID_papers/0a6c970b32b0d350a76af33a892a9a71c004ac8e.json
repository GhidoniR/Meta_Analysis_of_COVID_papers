Several consensus papers have reported that it is necessary for the brain to adapt to the new auditory stimulus transmitted by the implant [14] [15] [16] . However, rehabilitation after cochlear implantation differs among countries. In some countries, postoperative rehabilitation programs are not routinely offered because of a lack of reimbursement by health insurance companies and a shortage of specialized therapists [17] , whereas in others, cochlear implant (CI) recipients follow an intensive rehabilitation regime that is regularly covered by the general health insurance for at least 2 years after surgery [16] . Auditory training usually takes place in a face-to-face setting in specialized centers; computer-based applications are used only as an additive to standard (face-to-face) therapy. In a previous study, we developed Train2hear, which is a highly individualized digital training platform that combines different components of adaptivity, feedback, and motivation to allow CI users to receive computer-based auditory training (CBAT) that is tailored to their specific therapeutic needs. The first evaluation, within the setting of an applicant's workshop, clearly demonstrated that CI users enjoyed using Train2hear [18] .

In Schumann et al [22] 15 CI users received 3 weeks of training on phoneme discrimination. A control group and follow-up assessments were not included. Fu et al [23] used a similar approach and studied phoneme discrimination in 10 participants over 4 weeks. In addition to improved performance in trained skills, a transfer effect on sentence comprehension was observed. This observation contrasts with that of Stacey et al [24] who found a significant improvement in consonant discrimination but not in sentence comprehension. Self-perceived improvement was reported in only 2 of the 11 participants. The only publication so far that has compared standard face-to-face therapy with a computer-based approach was by Bernstein et al [6] who analyzed speech tracking ability in 9 patients after a 4-week period. In their study, the tracking rate was improved, but no difference was observed between the two methods. Furthermore, only a few studies have investigated the ability to listen in noise after CBAT [19, 21, 25] . However, there were conflicting results, with small number of participants. In Ingvalson et al [21] , 5 CI users with postlingual deafness and at least one year of hearing experience showed improved speech perception only in quiet conditions. In contrast, Oba et al [19] reported a significant improvement in babble and steady noise after a 4-week digit training in 10 participants with CI. Even Green et al [25] observed in 9 participants with postlingual deafness that the thresholds to understand 50% of the sentences presented in noise significantly improved after 4 weeks of training in noise, but transfer effects on phoneme discrimination and memorization could not be demonstrated.
