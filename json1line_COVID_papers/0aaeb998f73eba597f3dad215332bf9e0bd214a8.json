One of the intended effects of these NPIs has been to reduce population mobility. Due to the huge costs of implementing these NPIs, it is essential to have a good understanding of their efficacy. Using aggregated mobility data per country, released by Apple and Google we investigated the proportional contribution of NPIs to the magnitude and rate of mobility changes at a multi-national level. NPIs with the greatest impact on the magnitude of mobility change were lockdown measures; declaring a state of emergency; closure of businesses and public services and school closures. NPIs with the greatest effect on the rate of mobility change were implementation of lockdown measures and limitation of public gatherings. As confirmed by chisquare and cluster analysis, separately recorded NPIs like school closure and closure of businesses and public services were closely correlated with each other, both in timing and occurrence. This suggests that the observed significant NPI effects are mixed with and amplified by their correlated NPI measures. We observed direct and similar effects of NPIs on both Apple and Google mobility data. In addition, although Apple and Google data were obtained by different methods they were strongly correlated indicating that they are reflecting overall mobility on a country level. The availability of this data provides an opportunity for governments to build timely, uniform and cost-effective mechanisms to monitor COVID-19 or future pandemic countermeasures.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "npj Digital Medicine (2021) 4:81 ; https://doi.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) has had a huge impact on global health and economies, with costs of $11 trillion, projected (as of June 2020) by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) 1 . The implementation of governmental Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) has been the primary means of controlling the pandemic. NPIs have been issued by governments worldwide in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and collected by Assessment Capacities Project (ACAPS) 2 . ACAPS NPIs were standardised and included a secondary review and categorisation into five groups: social distancing, movement restrictions, public health measures, social and economic measures and lockdowns. These standardised NPIs and the corresponding methodology and data coding insights of ACAPS are freely available along with the actual interventions issued per country and the corresponding classifications 2 . The main parameters governing communication of infectious disease are duration of infectious period, infectiousness, susceptibility and opportunity. Of these parameters, opportunity is the most readily modulated without use of pharmaceuticals. It has been widely demonstrated in epidemiological studies that mobility is important in limiting opportunity for infection and several NPIs therefore target mobility. A strong reduction in mobility has a positive effect on reducing COVID-19 transmission by limiting opportunity for the virus to spread in the population and thus reducing the effective reproduction number \"R t \". The positive effect of issuing NPIs on the reduction of COVID-19 has already been reported for different regions and countries like Wuhan 3 , China 4-6 , Hong Kong 7 , the UK 8 , Spain 9 and Europe 10 . Due to the huge costs of implementing these NPIs, it is essential to have a good understanding of their benefits. It is plausible that NPIs with the same intention and thus classification may have different effects in different countries, as substantiated and reported by Haug et al. 11 The corresponding variation in effectiveness can be approximated by assessing the change in mobility in each country by using freely available aggregated phone-derived mobility data from Apple and Google 12, 13 .

This was mostly due to atypical mobility patterns like less clear lockdown effects. The average rate of reduction in mobility for the Apple data was 7.8% per day and ranged from 27.9% to 2.9% per day. The country with the fastest effect was South-Africa, where the effect of the NPIs was seen almost immediately, while the country with the slowest effect was the United Arab Emirates, where the effect of the NPIs was more gradual [Fig. 3 ]. The speed of effect for Apple data was normally distributed over all the countries. For Google RAR and Google TS data, normality could not be established.

Although the Apple data and Google (RAR and TS) data are derived from 16 . Although Apple market share worldwide is only 13.5% in Q2 of 2020 17 this varies greatly between countries. Apple states that the inclusion of countries in the dataset is based on the number of requests issued within the country 12 . With the knowledge that Apple and Google datasets are derived from a large proportion of the national populations, and using different modes of measuring mobility, the high correlation between the Apple and Google data indicates they are indeed representative of phone user mobility trends in general. While there may be some intrinsic biases, these are likely small and at the very least the trends can be said to apply to the substantial fraction of the population who contributed mobility data. While the Apple data was based on direction requests, Google data is based on actual visits to specific places. As the Google data did not depend on the type of smartphone used (iOS or Android), the coverage of this data is more than twice that of the Apple data (124 vs 59 countries). Google uses data from people with a google account who have their location history switched on to assess crowding of specific places. Due to the large number of contributing users we consider this data to be as good an approximation of general mobility in a country as is presently possible. Data for Retail and Recreation (RAR) and Transits and Stations (TS) showed clear lockdown effects like the Apple data did. However, as RAR and TS are more specific for a location than the Apple data, it might depend more on the country's infrastructure, traditions and habits whether effects are visible.

Our finding of close correlation between NPIs may, in part, explain why, in their study, the sequence of NPIs did not show a consistent association pattern with COVID-19 incidence. We found that effects of individual NPIs on the decrease in mobility were hard to distinguish as they were often issued within a few days from each other. Two of the most closely associated NPIs were school closures and closure of businesses and public services. The latter effect was selected in the Google RAR model while the first was selected in the more general Apple direction model.

The Google TS model was similar in this regard (50.3%), while the Google RAR model was more specific with 45.7% unattributable loss in mobility. This relatively large unattributable part is likely to be caused by the high association of individual NPIs with each other.

They are often issued jointly and different NPIs are, as we saw in this study, moderately correlated. This was also substantiated by Hale et al. 19 who proposed an aggregate stringency index based on all the NPIs issued in a country. As this index is a combination of different NPIs and their characteristics, it is according to Hale et al. a better predictor of death rates than the individual NPIs. The variability of NPI implementation and adherence are not provided in the NPI database. This was illustrated by Drake et al. 8 who examined the effect of NPIs on mobility in the UK using the same Google data. They observed a decrease in adherence to movement restrictions over time though this overlooks the between-country-effects of NPIs. The % remaining mobility in a country, combined with the duration of low mobility, is therefore likely to be a better estimate to correlate with the case and death rates than the specific NPIs issued.

When assessing the direct effect of NPIs on COVID-19 cases, there will be a lag of at least 14 days due to incubation timing and a delay of disease transfers. Rather than the delayed COVID-19 direct measures like cases and deaths, the effects of loosening the NPIs and the behavioural rebound of the population can be more immediately examined using the mobility rates.

Even more accurate behavioural changes in activity after the implementation of NPIs can be observed in greater detail by analysing data collected directly through smartphones and wearables 20 .

This two-phase decline can be explained by the initial lower effective NPIs issued and subsequent full-lockdown after which mobility was rapidly reduced to a very low level. This illustrates that the model of speed of decline is more viable in the initial clear mobility transition and is less usable for the later periods in the COVID-19 epidemic where NPIs are more gradually issued and withdrawn.
