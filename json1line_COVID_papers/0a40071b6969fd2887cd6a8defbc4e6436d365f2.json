To get insights into the possible role of the immune system upon COVID-19 infection, 2811 genes of the gene ontology term \"immune system process GO: 0002376\" were selected for coexpression analysis of the human targets of SARS-CoV-2 (HT-SARS-CoV-2) ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN in tissue samples from patients with cancer and diabetes mellitus. The network between HT-SARS-CoV-2 and immune system process genes was analyzed based on functional protein associations using STRING. In addition, STITCH was employed to determine druggable targets. DPP4 was the only immune system process gene, which was coexpressed with the three HT-SARS-CoV-2 genes, while eight other immune genes were at least coexpressed with two HT-SARS-CoV-2 genes. STRING analysis between immune and HT-SARS-CoV-2 genes plotted 19 associations of which there were eight common networking genes in mixed healthy (323) and pan-cancer (11003) tissues in addition to normal (87), cancer (90), and diabetic (128) pancreatic tissues. Using this approach, three commonly applicable druggable connections between HT-SARS-CoV-2 and immune system process genes were identified. These include positive associations of ACE2-DPP4 and TMPRSS2-SRC as well as a negative association of FURIN with ADAM17. Furthermore, 16 drugs were extracted from STITCH (score <0.8) with 32 target genes.

However, the relationship between these molecules has to be analyzed and further experimentally validated concerning the possible targeting of ACE2/DPP4 and FURIN/ADAM17-related factors in diseased COVID-19 patients. The delicate balance between ACE2, ADAM17, and TMPRSS2 interactions could be decisive for the clinical outcome of COVID-19 (45). Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) similar to angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, act by preventing the formation of angiotensin II rather than by blocking the binding of angiotensin II to muscle cells on blood vessels. The therapeutic indication for ARBs prescription comprises control of high blood pressure, treating heart failure, and preventing kidney failure, especially in patients suffering from diabetes mellitus. Since ACE inhibitors are associated with cough, accumulation of bradykinin, and angioedema, ARBs, like losartan and captopril, might be a more favorable therapeutic option by blocking the binding and attachment of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain to ACE2-expressing cells, thereby inhibiting the infection of host cells (46) . Ferrario and colleagues reported that the administration of either ACE inhibitors or ARBs increased the levels of ACE2 mRNA in Lewis rats, compared to rats receiving placebo (47) . In particular, the cardiac levels of ACE2 mRNA expression increased by 4.7-fold or 2.8-fold in rats treated with losartan, which was accompanied by increased ACE2 activity. Treatment with the ACE inhibitor captopril can significantly increase ACE2 protein expression in rats with acute lung injury (48) .
