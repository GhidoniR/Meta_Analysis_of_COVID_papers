We made the following observations: (1) During the first period of the pandemic, patients with IJDs had approximately 1.5-2 times higher mortality from any cause than the general population. (2) In relative terms, this increase was not higher than during previous years, and could almost entirely be explained by comorbidities and socioeconomic factors. (3) In absolute terms, the risks for admission to hospital due to COVID-19 (0.5%, an additional 0.2 per 100 persons compared with the general population), to intensive care due to COVID-19 (0.04%, an additional 0.01 per 100 persons) and for death due to COVID-19 (0.10%, an additional 0.03 per 100 persons) among patients with IJDs were low. (4) The increased relative risks were not specific to COVID-19-related outcomes but present also for hospitalisations and deaths due to any cause. (5) Patients treated with b/tsDMARDs were, on average, not at higher risk for COVID-19-related outcomes than those on csDMARDs. (6) We noted increased risks for rituximab and for JAKi for COVID-19 outcomes, based on a limited number of events. Taking differences in study design and the comparisons made (if any) in previous reports on COVID-19, our results add to the emerging picture that a diagnosis of chronic IJDs per se does not seem to increase the risk of serious COVID-19-related outcomes, but that age and comorbidities are strong risk factors for these outcomes. 6 9-13 This is not to say that IJDs themselves do not increase mortality-our study population comprised unselected patients with a mean disease duration around a decade. Many comorbidities and socioeconomic characteristics may thus have occurred as a consequence of the IJD.

Importantly, our results indicate that during March-September of the pandemic 2020, the increase in all-cause mortality and the risks for COVID-19-related outcomes in patients with IJD remained largely proportional to those in the general population. Our results have important implications for patient counselling in that they suggest that (1) The absolute risk of death from COVID-19 among individuals with IJD between March and September was in the order of 1 in a 1000, (2) The additional risk in individuals with IJD compared with the general population was in the order of 3 per 10000, and (3) In a given individual with RA or another IJD, the health status seems much more important than the IJD diagnosis per se, both for overall mortality and for COVID-19-outcomes.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Epidemiology"}, {"text": "Previous reports have generally not suggested particular risks with TNFi or other cytokine inhibitors, at least when used in monotherapy, 6 8 and even suggested a protective effect of TNFi. 10 Our results suggest that csDMARDs, TNFi, abatacept and tocilizumab are neutral in terms of risks for serious COVID-19-outcomes. Baricitinib has been reported to exert beneficial effects when used against COVID-19. 21 While our results for JAKi are in seeming disagreement, they were based on small numbers and we cannot refute residual confounding. For rituximab, for which there is also substantial clinical channelling, the increased risks were not specific to COVID-19. Similar signals for rituximab have been observed in reports on bDMARDs and risks for other infections. 22 In either case, these results call for verification. An association between sulfasalazine and severe COVID-19 was recently reported. 23 Our post hoc analysis did not unequivocally confirm or reject this signal (online supplemental analysis). Because of the intimate correlation between disease activity and lack of alternative treatment options, and since we did not have prospective information on glucocorticoid dosing or disease activity from start of follow-up nor at the time point of any COVID-19 infection, we adjusted for but abstained from assessing risks specifically in relation to glucocorticoids. Our study has limitations. We assessed risks for outcomes of known COVID-19 cases, but similar to most previous studies could not study risks for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first place. While we had the possibility to compare risks between patients with IJDs to age-matched, sex-matched and domicilematched general population referents, all risks presented represent averages across age and sex and are as such not directly applicable to individual patients. In the assessment of risks with individual DMARDs, we used a propensity score weighting approach to accommodate confounding by indication. For this, we included a wide array of covariates from several different domains and achieved good balance, but we cannot exclude residual confounding, and lack reliable data on several known COVID-19 risk factors such as body mass index and hypertension. We defined DMARD exposure on the basis of active treatment at the beginning of the study period, but can only speculate about patient-initiated discontinuations or dose reductions related to fear of COVID-19.

This design enabled the estimation of absolute risks and of the corresponding relative risks comparing both within patients with inflammatory disease and versus the general population, rather than, for example, a restriction to internal comparisons within patients with rheumatic disease and COVID-19. 10 In conclusion, the increased risks of hospitalisation and death due to COVID-19 among patients with IJDs largely mirror those in the general population, at least in relative terms. In absolute terms, risks and excess risks are low. csDMARDs, TNF inhibitors, abatacept and tocilizumab as used in clinical practice appear safe, but signals for rituximab and JAKis require verification to determine whether these are specific to COVID-19 or reflective of channelling.
