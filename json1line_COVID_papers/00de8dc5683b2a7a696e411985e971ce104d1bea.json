We have no information on reasons physicians did not participate which could have been numerous; e.g., the invitation went to \"junk mail,\" no experience with or observations of patients discriminating against POC, no interest in participating because of the topic or in a time consuming interview, or racial fatigue of POC at having to constantly \"tell their story.\" 30 In conclusion, our findings contribute to a mounting body of evidence that physicians who do not match patients' mental model of a physician as White, male, and able-bodied can be targets of demeaning and belittling behaviors from patients. While achieving a respectful work environment for all physicians will require a cultural change, there are actions health care organizations can take immediately to work toward this goal. 52, 53
