On the contrary, a higher share of the service sector in overall electricity consumption or of work-related commuters amplifies the negative effect. However, we should also mention a possible caveat at this point. When using aggregated data, one loses the information provided by individual heterogeneity. For instance, the change in electricity consumption is a mixture of the response of all companies and households in the population.

First, as shown in Section 5.1, the lockdown led to a reduction in electricity demand. Second, favourable weather conditions boosted the electricity production of renewable energy resources. Due to an increase in the supply of renewable energies and a simultaneous decline in demand, fossil fuel power plants are pushed up the merit order curve. With electricity prices below their marginal costs, conventional producers are forced to stop production. Therefore, the structural change in electricity generation and the associated change in emissions are particularly striking in Germany, where electricity production still heavily relies on fossil fuels. Table 3 displays the quarterly g CO 2 equivalent per produced and imported kWh between 2017 and 2020. The figures reflect a seasonal pattern with higher g CO 2 equivalent per imported kWh in the first and last quarter of each year. The effect of the lockdown is also immediately visible. Thus, in the first quarter of 2020 the CO 2 equivalent amounted to 227.5 g and was thus 33.7% lower than in the first quarter of 2019 or even 43.5% lower compared to the average g CO 2 equivalent of Q1 2017-2019. In the lower part of the table we also report the results of a t-test (difference in means). The t-test and the associated pvalues show a statistically significant difference between average CO 2 equivalent per Table 3 .

Figure 4 displays the results of an event study of the effect of the lockdown on CO 2 emissions that stem from electricity imports. The regression is equivalent to the one presented in equation (1) except that the dependent variable are CO 2 emissions per imported kWH and this time we include as additional covariates solar and wind electricity production in the neighbouring countries (Austria, Germany, and France) in MW, to control also for the supply side in terms of adequate conditions for renewable electricity production. Furthermore, we also control for the share of imported electricity from each of the three neighbouring countries. The reference period is the week prior to the start of the lockdown period, and hence the coefficient for this week is normalized to 0. The results show that CO 2 emissions of imported electricity drastically and gradually declined after the 16th of March 2020. The most pronounced reduction of more than 50% was reached in weeks 3 and 4 after the lockdown was implemented. Table 4 displays the results of the event study analysis on CO 2 emissions. In column (1) we present the effect for each CW after the introduction of the lockdown whereas column (2) displays the results for the cumulative effect. Columns (3) and (4) use information for weekdays only. All specifications account for weekdays, holidays, week, and hour fixed effects. The results show that the cumulative reduction in CO 2 emissions per kWH of imported electricity amounted to between 26.3% and 32.7% after the lockdown, depending on the specification.

Our findings reveal a decline in electricity consumption of 4.6% (7.4% if we focus on working days only) and a large variation between cantons. Whereas the decrease was less pronounced in German-speaking cantons in the north-eastern part of Switzerland, the drop was more dramatic in Geneva, Neuch\u00e2tel, Ticino, Valais, and Vaud where the decline in electricity use even reached up to \u00c017.3%. These differences are not only explained by the severity of the pandemic in terms of number of cases which were much higher in these regions but also by the more drastic response of the local governments. For instance, Ticino enacted more stringent regulations on top of the ones decided by the federal government. Our study thus helps understand how a lockdown can affect the economy and to what extent the heterogeneity in the severity of the measures imposed is reflected into economic activity. The overall 4.6% decline in electricity use can be translated into an almost 7% output decrease, assuming households account for 33% of electricity consumption. This is actually a lower bound estimate if, due to the required home office, the households' share in overall electricity consumption is higher than 33%. An electricity demand decline of \u00c014.3% or even \u00c017.3% as recorded in Ticino or Valais implies an output reduction of up to \u00c021.5% or even \u00c026%.
