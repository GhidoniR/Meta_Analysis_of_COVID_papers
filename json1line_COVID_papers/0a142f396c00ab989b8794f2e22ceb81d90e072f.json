Two small clinical trials have shown short-term high dose vitamin D supplementation may prevent prostate cancer progression. There is no substantial evidence for its long-term safety and efficacy, hence its use in the care of men with PC on AS needs assessment.

Studies have shown that prevalence of chromosomal aberrations (CA) is 2.2-to 2.4-fold higher in cancer patients than in non-cancer controls, and that micronuclei (MN) formation, a marker for chromosomal instability, was associated with increased cancer incidence in a study of 6718 individuals. 21 There is also evidence to link telomeres to cancer risk. 22 Telomeres are repetitive TTAGGG DNA sequences that maintain genomic stability by protecting the ends of chromosomes; they shorten in length over time in normal somatic tissues due to incomplete replication of the telomere. Telomere shortening is accelerated by oxidative stress, inflammation and cell proliferation and has been linked with induction of cell senescence which guards against survival of genomically abnormal cells. 23 Evidence from prospective studies show positive associations between telomere length and various cancers, including that for low-grade (OR 1.13, 95% CI:1.01-1.27) and localised PC (OR 1.12, 95% CI:1.01-1.24) disease, possibly due to abnormal telomerase expression and telomere elongation, which enables the survival of genomically unstable cells, their unrestricted growth and their evolution into cancer.

A major drawback of AS is the uncertainty whether a patient truly has 63 low risk PC based on biopsy alone. Multiparametric MRI scan together with biopsy, appears useful in 64 separating patients who need curative therapy from those for whom AS may be safe. Two small clinical 65 trials have shown short-term high dose vitamin D supplementation may prevent prostate cancer 66progression. There is no substantial evidence for its long-term safety and efficacy, hence its use in the67 care of men with PC on AS needs assessment. This protocol describes the ProsD clinical trial which 68 aims to determine if oral high dose vitamin D supplementation taken monthly for 2 years can prevent 69 prostate cancer progression in cases with low-intermediate risk of progression. Method and analysis: This is an Australian national multi-centre, 2:1 double-blinded placebo-71 controlled Phase II RCT of monthly oral high-dose vitamin D supplementation (50,000IU 72 cholecalciferol), in men diagnosed with localised PC who have low-intermediate risk of disease 73 progression and are being managed by AS. This trial will assess the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of 74 supplementing men with an initial oral loading dose of 500,000IU cholecalciferol, followed by a 75 monthly oral dose of 50,000IU during the 24 months of AS. The primary trial outcome is the 76 commencement of active therapy for clinical or non-clinical reason, within 2-years of AS.

Results from the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) suggest minimal benefits in 100 men with low-risk PC when managed with curative treatment, and instead recommended monitoring 101 the course of PC with the intention of initiating curative treatment if and when the cancer progresses. Referred to as active surveillance (AS), this management option has evolved as an alternative to 103 immediate active treatment for those diagnosed with low grade disease. 4 Consequently, AS is now the 104 preferred management strategy for most men with low-risk PC. It aims to avoid overtreatment of 105 clinically indolent disease by safely delaying definitive treatment until evidence of progression is 107 The following augmented risk classification for low, intermediate and high-risk groups is used as 109 \uf0b7 Low risk: PSA < 10 ng/mL, and Gleason 3+3 or less, 2 or less positive biopsy cores and 110 clinical stage T1-T2a. 111 \uf0b7 Intermediate: PSA 10 to<20 ng/mL or Gleason 7 (Gleason 3+4 or Gleason 4+3) or clinical 112 stage T2b-c sub-divided into: 113 -Favourable risk: Gleason 3+3 (with PSA 10 to <20 ng/mL or T2b-c) or Gleason 3+4.114-Non-favourable risk: Gleason 3+4 (with PSA 10 to <20 ng/mL or T2b-c), or Gleason 116 \uf0b7 High-risk: PSA > 20ng/mL, or Gleason 8 or greater, or clinical stage >T3.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF23": {"text": "118while curative/active treatment is widely adopted for men with intermediate to high risk disease .[8][9][10][11] 119There is mounting evidence that men with favourable intermediate risk PC may have similar 120 mortality risk as those with low risk disease. These men may therefore be good candidates for AS, as 121 a safe first-line management option, although the consensus to accurately define this sub-group of PC PC is conventionally diagnosed using transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) to guide prostate biopsy (PB). As 125 cancer cannot be imaged on ultrasound, the major limitation of this approach is non-detection of a 126 substantial proportion of significant PC. Sampling error can lead to the misdiagnosis of clinically 127 significant disease, which may be upgraded at repeat biopsy. Referred to as reclassification, this gives 128 the perception of disease progression, subsequently leading to overtreatment. The Prostate Cancer 129 Research International Active Surveillance Project, referred to as the PRIAS Project, estimated that For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml 130 approximately 28% of PRIAS participants showed reclassification upon repeat biopsy. 13-15 The use of 131 mpMRI, originally used for staging, is now routinely used for tumour detection and localisation, 132 allowing image-guided targeted sampling to overcome the limitations of the traditional blind PB. 133 mpMRI is able to detect both high-grade and larger tumours accurately, which means it may perform 134 particularly well for detection of clinically significant disease. 16-18 It can improve the specificity of 135 locating PC and targeting the PB. It can also differentiate low-and intermediate/high-grade PC, 136 thereby providing more accurate risk classification of PC. 138 Two recent clinical trials in PC patients suggest that vitamin D supplementation may prevent PC 139 progression. 19 20 Daily supplementation of 4000IU for one year reduced the number of positive cores 140 and Gleason grade, but did not reduce PSA levels. 19 A daily high dose of 40,000IU for only 10 weeks 141 significantly reduced PSA levels but did not change Ki67 expression in prostate tissue. Those who 142 received 4000IU and 10,000IU showed no significant reduction in PSA level. 20 Duration of follow-up 143 was short in both these trials and may have resulted in the lack of significant findings. Further trials of 144 high vitamin D doses to prevent PC progression are therefore required. Trials are also needed to 145 assess the long-term safety of vitamin D supplementation in cancer patients. Prostate Cancer and Genome Damage 147 There is a strong link between the prevalence of markers of genome damage and cancer risk. Studies 148 have shown that prevalence of chromosomal aberrations (CA) is 2.2-to 2.4-fold higher in cancer 149 patients than in non-cancer controls, and that micronuclei (MN) formation, a marker for chromosomal 150 instability, was associated with increased cancer incidence in a study of 6718 individuals. 21 There is 151 also evidence to link telomeres to cancer risk. 22 Telomeres are repetitive TTAGGG DNA sequences 152 that maintain genomic stability by protecting the ends of chromosomes; they shorten in length over 153 time in normal somatic tissues due to incomplete replication of the telomere. Telomere shortening is 154 accelerated by oxidative stress, inflammation and cell proliferation and has been linked with induction 155 of cell senescence which guards against survival of genomically abnormal cells. 23 Evidence from 156 prospective studies show positive associations between telomere length and various cancers, including 157 that for low-grade (OR 1.13, 95% CI:1.01-1.27) and localised PC (OR 1.12, 95% CI:1.01-1.24) 158 disease, possibly due to abnormal telomerase expression and telomere elongation, which enables the 159 survival of genomically unstable cells, their unrestricted growth and their evolution into cancer. 24-26 160 There is evidence to show that some micronutrients are essential to prevent genome damage but the 161 specific impact of vitamin D is only just starting to be explored. 27 162 Evidence suggests that high levels of vitamin D metabolites (25(OH)D and 1,25(OH) 2 D) may prevent 163 genome damage in leukocytes by reducing prevalence of MN formation and by maintaining adequate 164 telomere length. 28-32 There is also evidence to suggest that 1,25(OH) 2 D may inhibit telomerase activity 165 in tumour tissue in a pathway involving miRNA498, a non-coding small RNA. 33 This current trial For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF24": {"text": "Trial participants will be recruited from 15 private Australian urology clinics located inAustralia,   195   with the corresponding ethics approval being obtained for all sites.

Although it is approved to treat conditions relating to vitamin D deficiency, its use is not approved to treat prostate cancer due to insufficient evidence. This is a two year clinical trial which aims to see if vitamin D can prevent disease progression in men with prostate cancer who have chosen to be on active surveillance. It also aims to also establish the safety of its use in these men.This trial is led by Professor Howard Gurney from Macquarie University, in conjunction with researchers at Cancer Council NSW, and a team of Australian urologists, geneticists and vitamin D experts.
