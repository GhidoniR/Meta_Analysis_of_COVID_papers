We consider active infection in the case of a positive PCR test, indicating the current presence of genetic material of the virus itself in the individual samples, and previous exposure in the case of a positive serological test, identifying the presence of antibodies against an infectious agent in the individual samples. In the case of real-time PCR, the cut-off for positivity was Ct < 35 (Ct is cycle threshold). We also included positive and negative controls for each run. In the conventional PCR, we also included positive and negative controls. In this case, the PCR product is observed as a band in the electrophoresis gel when the target is present in the sample. As for the ELISA tests, we considered positive results according to the manufacturer's information. In the case of FHV-1, FCV and FPV, test kits are based on solid-phase immunoassay technology. The concentration of antibodies in serum samples is measured using the color-coded scale (\"CombScale\") provided in the kit. The test kit results are documented in \"S\" units (ImmunoComb Score) on a scale of 0 to 6, where the positive value S3 corresponds to a 1:80 titer by virus neutralization test (VN) for FPV, 1:16 titer by VN for FHV-1 and 1:32 titer by VN for FCV. In the case of CDV, PV and SuHV-1 ELISA tests, we followed the manufacturer's recommendations to differentiate seropositive and seronegative animals (positive threshold = sample optical density/positive control optical density >0.2, >0.15 and >0.35, respectively). For FeLV Agp27 and the FIV ELISA test, a positive test result was determined by color development in the sample spots from the device's \"Result Window\".

This is the first report of a disease screening in a reintroduced population of Iberian lynxes. As it occurred in previous disease surveillances in the last strongholds of the species in Southern Spain (Do\u00f1ana and Sierra Morena [13, 14] ), the prevalence of active and previous infections can be considered low in all reintroduction/study sites. Our results also concur with the surveys performed on the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx [24, 39, 40] ), the Canada lynx (L. canadensis [41] ) or the bobcat (L. rufus [42] ). We believe that this may derive due to the solitary social structure of the species, which limits the frequency of intraspecific contacts ( [13, 43] ). Another hypothesis that may explain the low seroprevalence includes the low rates of survival of lynxes infected with viruses [14] or that a reintroduced species may benefit from a temporary enemy release-like effect in the form of reduced parasite pressure, at least during a restricted period of time in which reintroduced native hosts are expected to encounter parasites that are well-adapted to exploiting them [11] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 557, "end": 561, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 562, "end": 565, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 758, "end": 762, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 763, "end": 766, "text": "39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 767, "end": 770, "text": "40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 805, "end": 809, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 836, "end": 840, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 984, "end": 988, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 989, "end": 992, "text": "43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1122, "end": 1126, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1411, "end": 1415, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "A remarkable difference from this study is that all reintroduced lynxes were vaccinated against the most common feline viral pathogens (FHV-1, FCV, FPV and FeLV), so conferring immunity from the vaccination may prevent the reintroduced lynxes from developing infections, at least during part of the time of the study. Once released, only a FeLV booster was administered to the reintroduced lynxes. Additionally, FeLV primo-vaccinations and boosters were administered to wild-born lynxes during the trapping season. This may explain the low contact rates with this agent in the reintroduced population at all reintroduction/study sites, even after contact with currently infected domestic cats during intraguild predations [44] . Only one juvenile wild-born lynx found dead was FeLV provirus-positive and coinfected with SuHV-1. FeLV was the only virus consistently detected in feral cats from all areas sampled. The prevalence ranged from 9-23%, which is higher compared to owned cats tested at the national level (2.6% (1.4-4.8) [45] ), similar to what was found in the remnant lynx populations between 2004-2006 (23% [14] ) and lower in domestic cats surveyed at the two Iberian lynx reintroduction areas from Andalusia (29.5% [46] ).

Although this sample subset was small, we registered one previous exposure to FPV and FCV in one subadult lynx from MRV. Moreover, we also registered an active infection of FPV in a road-killed reintroduced subadult lynx. No lesions associated with this pathogen were observed during the necropsy, maybe because this finding occurred during an initial stage of the infection due to the protection generated by the previous vaccination or due to the ability to control the infection by the individual. The exposure to FPV in feral cats from this area reached 12.5% and FCV reached 82%. Unlike FCV, where direct contact is the typical mode of transmission, the feces of FPV-infected cats present long environmental survival, making indirect contact the most common and main transmission route [47] . We hypothesized that contact with this agent may be more frequent in areas where the prevalence in cats is high. Lower parvovirus (feline or canine, since the tests performed did not allow to differentiate the strain) contact rates were recorded in the sympatric wild carnivore community. The prevalence of the parvovirus in the carnivore community was lower compared to other serosurveys carried out in other lynx territories [14] .

In this case, our results are in consonance with those obtained by [50] . We may find higher CDV prevalence than in the former studies, since the reintroduction landscape was free from apex predators for decades, and under that scenario, meso-carnivores thrive, along with multihost pathogens; higher lynx meso-predator contact rates may occur when the reintroduction begins [6] . During an ecological study in MRV, where changes in the carnivore community were examined before and after the Iberian lynx reintroduction, seventeen intraguild predations were detected [6, 44] . These interactions well-provided the arena for the direct transmission of pathogens such as CDV. This virus was present in the carnivore community in three out of four reintroduction/study sites. At the VI study site, the CDV prevalence was significantly higher than the rest. Eighty-nine percent (8/9) of red foxes and 100% (3/3) of genets were positive. Two foxes were also CDV PCR-positive in this area. This differs from a study from two Iberian lynx reintroduction areas in Andalusia, where a current infection of CDV in a sample of 146 carnivores was not detected [46] . At MRV, 44% (4/9) of red foxes, 8% (2/24) of feral cats and 7% (1/14) of Egyptian mongooses were positive.

In a previous study, [19] found high viral loads in a dead lynx, as well as a positive RT-PCR stone marten.

Since the discovery, suitable samples from dead lynxes were subjected to screening of the pathogen, and, in 2019, a new case aroused. In this case, a reintroduced, adult female lynx succumbed to the disease. We performed a serological survey in a subset of samples that failed to detect antibodies. This is in agreement with the serological findings in another imperiled species, the Florida puma (Puma concolor coryi), where no evidence of prior exposure was observed in live-captured pumas and where Aujeszky's disease may be a significant but underdiagnosed mortality factor in this species [52] .

Since wild boar are considered the main prey for this species [53] , these results may be due to a natural coevolution of the predator with a common pathogen from its main prey or may be caused by the exposure of tigers to low pathogenic strains of SuHV-1, a mechanism described for nonfatal disease encounters in hunting dogs [54] .
