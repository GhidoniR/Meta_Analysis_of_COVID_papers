The present work is an investigation of the newly synthesized 4-benzyl-1-(2,4,6-trimethyl-benzyl)-piperidine (M1BZP) molecule's inhibitory potential against important protein targets of SARS-CoV-2 using computational approaches. M1BZP crystallizes in monoclinic type with P1211 space group. For the title compound M1BZP, spectroscopic characterization like 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, FTIR, were carried out. The geometry of the compound had been optimized by the DFT method and its results were compared with the X-ray diffraction data. The calculated energies for the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) showed the stability and reactivity of the title compound. Intermolecular interactions in the crystal network were determined using Hirshfeld surface analyses. The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) picture was drawn using the same level of theory to visualize the chemical reactivity and charge distribution on the molecule. Molecular docking study performed for the synthesized compound revealed an efficient interaction with the COVID-19 protease and resulted in good activities. We hope the present study would help workers in the field to develop potential vaccines and therapeutics against the novel coronavirus.

Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is a novel single-stranded RNA virus of the Coronaviridae family [1] . Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus primarily affects the respiratory system, other organ systems are also involved. Lower respiratory tract infection related symptoms including fever, dry cough, and dyspnea were reported. It is now widely recognized that respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 are extremely heterogeneous, ranging from minimal symptoms to significant hypoxia with ARDS [2] . Being RNA viruses, CoVs readily evolve by mutation and homologous and non-homologous recombination, which expands their host range and facilitates the crossing of species barriers [3] . Coronaviruses are spherical in shape. Their most prominent feature is club-like projections on the virus surface which are referred to as \"spikes\". Human coronaviruses are positive-sense RNA (30 kb) viruses. Two types of proteins characterize HCoVs, structural protein [spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N)], and non-structural proteins (nsp1 up to nsp16) including the RNA dependent RNA polymerase [4, 5] . Among non-structural proteins, nsp12 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-RdRp) is important in the replication and transcription of the viral genome [6] . For SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, the S protein is the primary determinant for host tropism and pathogenicity. It is the main target for neutralizing antibodies and therefore of great interest in terms of immunological response and vaccine design [7] . When we set our sights on the broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, we found that a drug unlisted, Remdesivir, has demonstrated strength in trials related to MERS-CoV and Ebola virus infection. In the United States, the first patient with COVID-19 has shown significant improvement in clinical symptoms within 24 h of treatment with Remdesivir [8] [9] [10] . This case has convinced the public that Remdesivir could become a new \"specific drug\" for COVID-19. Because of the urgency and current need, scientists are involved in reusing already approved drug candidates to test in COVID-19 patients. This is carried out to reduce cost, time, and also the risks involved in the drug development process. No drug or vaccine has been approved yet. Pei Liu et al identified several N-substituted compounds as potent SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease inhibitors [11] . Sathiskumar et al tested several coumarin analogues as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 [12] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 365, "end": 368, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 746, "end": 749, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 932, "end": 935, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1356, "end": 1359, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1360, "end": 1362, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1508, "end": 1511, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1755, "end": 1758, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2099, "end": 2102, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2103, "end": 2106, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2107, "end": 2111, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2604, "end": 2608, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2693, "end": 2697, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Computer-aided drug design technology minimizes wastage of time and financial burden in the drug discovery process.

These methods avoid wasting time on a lead compound that would be toxic or metabolized by the body into an inactive form and unable to cross membranes. These ADMET parameters disclose the behaviour of the chemical compounds in a living organism. Understanding physicochemical properties are necessary for designing new pharmacological compounds.
