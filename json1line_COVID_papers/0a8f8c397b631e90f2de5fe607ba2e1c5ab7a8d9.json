The objective of this study was to estimate the incidence of and risk factors for COVID-19-related UMVs after outpatient COVID-19 diagnosis or positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Methods: Data for this retrospective cohort study were from the Optum \u00d2 de-identified COVID-19 Electronic Health Record database from June 1 to December 9, 2020. Adults with first COVID-19 diagnosis or positive SARS-CoV-2 test in outpatient settings were identified. Cumulative incidence function analysis stratified by risk factors was used to estimate the 30-day incidence of COVID-19-related UMVs. Competing risk regression models were used to derive adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for factors associated with UMVs. Results: Among 206,741 patients [58.8% female, 77.5% non-Hispanic Caucasian, mean (SD) age: 46.7 (17.8) years], the 30-day incidence was 9.4% (95% CI 9.3-9.6) for COVID-19related emergency room (ER)/urgent care (UC)/ hospitalizations and 3.8% (95% CI 3.7-3.9) for COVID-19-related hospitalizations. Likelihood of hospitalization increased with age and body mass index, with age the strongest risk factor (aHR 5.61; 95% CI 4.90-6.32 for patients C 85 years). Increased likelihood of hospitalization was observed for first presentation in the ER/UC vs. non-ER/UC outpatient settings (aHR 2.35; 95% CI 2.22-2.47) and prior all-cause hospitalization (aHR 1.90; 95% CI 1.79-2.00). Clinical risk factors of hospitalizations included pregnancy, uncontrolled diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, and autoimmune disease. A study limitation is that data on COVID-19 severity and symptoms were not captured. Conclusion: Predictors of COVID-19-related UMVs include older age, obesity, and several comorbidities.

However, with expanded testing, most patients who develop COVID-19 are likely to be initially diagnosed in the outpatient setting. The uncertain natural history of COVID-19 in outpatients presents challenges to health care providers for predicting which patients will subsequently need additional care. Estimating the incidence of COVID-related urgent medical visits (UMVs) to the emergency room (ER), urgent care (UC), or hospital settings and identifying factors associated with these return visits may inform patient management and resource allocation. Such information may be relevant given the initially positive results of trials of monoclonal antibodies for preventing severe COVID-19 among patients first seen in the outpatient setting [4, 5] and the recent granting of Emergency Use Authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration to these two therapies, REGEN-COV2 (a cocktail of casirivimab and imdevimab) and LY-CoV555 (bamlanivimab) [6, 7] . Additionally, publication of a clinical trial of COVID-19 treatment in an outpatient setting [8] suggests the value of characterizing this population for informing design and outcomes of such clinical trials.
