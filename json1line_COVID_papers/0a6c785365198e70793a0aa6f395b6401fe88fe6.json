Zhao et al. [1] found that anthropogenic PM 2.5 (fine particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less) exposure in China resulted in 1.08 million premature deaths in 2012. In addition to PM 2.5 , other types of air pollutants like nitrogen oxide (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO), and photochemical smog and their derivatives through physical and chemical reactions also induce serious health problems in China. A large body of literature has confirmed the link between vehicular emissions and air pollution [2, 3] and the corresponding health problems [4] . For instance, Li and Yin [5] calculated the share of traffic-related air pollution in urban total air pollution emission and found that 63% of CO and 37% of NOx were generated by urban vehicular emissions in China. With the increase of private vehicles in China, traffic-related air pollution may become more and more serious if there is no adoption of appropriate one single city, researches on a cross-city comparison in terms of the relationship between the expanded subway and local air quality also suggest the existence of the substitution effect. Based on 45 newly opened rail lines of 14 cities in China, Liang and Xi [18] found that the improved rail transit may induce more commuters to escape from cars, especially taxis, which contributes to the improvement in air quality. Gu et al. [19] examined the relationship between transit-oriented development and air quality in 37 Chinese cities, and also found that rail-based transit-oriented development contributes to better air quality. However, some researchers also found the insignificance of the substitution effect in China. Zhang et al. [20] found that improved rail transit has a small and statistically insignificant effect on the travel mode of residents with cars after the analysis of a survey data on travel energy consumption in Beijing. Wang et al. [21] found that the short-term impact of subway expansion on PM 10 tends to be positive, while negative in the longer term based on the PSM-DID method.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 217, "end": 220, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 745, "end": 748, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 749, "end": 751, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 790, "end": 793, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 821, "end": 824, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1422, "end": 1426, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1592, "end": 1596, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1899, "end": 1903, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2119, "end": 2123, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In summary, the transport\u2212air pollution literature predicts that the final impact of subway expansions on air quality could go in either direction.

First, this study adopts high-frequency air quality data at the monitor level together with subway lines in the same city to identify the causal relationship between subway expansions and air pollution. Second, we construct a continuous subway density indicator to reflect the subway network density change, which allows us to identify subway expansions' marginal impact instead of only focusing on the magnitude of air quality change due to the first subway line.

Nanjing, as the capital of Jiangsu Province, is a highly urbanized and industrialized city as well as the central city in the northwestern Yangtze River Delta (YRD). Nanjing also experiences a gradually deteriorating air quality along with its rapid economic development. Figure 1 shows the daily change in PM 2.5 concentrations in Nanjing from 13 May 2014 to 31 December 2018. The concentration level of most days during this process is above the World Health Organization (WHO) 24 h guideline value, and the yearly average level is up to 52.4 \u00b5g/m 3 , that is about two-thirds of the Chinese annual standard. Air pollution represents the largest single environmental health risk over the world according to the WHO [24] . A 2013 assessment by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of WHO also concluded that the association between ambient air pollution and an increase in cancer incidence had been confirmed, especially lung cancer and cancer of the urinary tract/bladder (See: https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/ detail/ambient-(outdoor)-air-quality-and-health for more information). Power plants, vehicles, and industrial activities all contribute to the increase of outdoor air pollution, though identifying the specific share of transport-related sources is challenging as vehicular emissions usually induce secondary air pollutants after physical or chemical processes. However, according to the statistics of China's National Bureau of Statistics (CNBS), the annual average concentration of PM 2.5 in Nanjing was 74 in 2014, while only 43 in 2018. Its subway system, meanwhile, has achieved a well-developed transport network and the number of trips by public transport have accounted for 50% of total travel in the urban area.

From 2014 to 2018, 8 new subway lines were constructed, reaching a total of 378.38 km.

During this period, 8 new subway lines with 104 stations were constructed, accounting for almost two-thirds of the total in operation by the end of 2018. The AQI is based on the abovementioned six atmospheric pollutants that measure daily air quality according to a scale of 0 to 500: the higher the value, the greater the air pollution and health risks. The main explanatory variable in this study is the indicator that reflects the opening dates and locations of subway lines. Figure 4 shows the layout of monitoring stations and subway stations in Nanjing in 2018, most of the high-supply areas of subway services lie in the urban area around the city center.

This measure could be regarded as a transformation of the gravity model in physics, which reflects the number of subway stations centered around a specific monitoring station. More subway lines indicate higher subway density, however, monitors that are closer to new subway lines will have a higher level of density. Therefore, these stations are expected to record a better air quality as commuters nearby are more likely to substitute from cars to the subway. Figure 5 reports the subway density changes of each block (calculated based on Equation (1)) across the city with the subway expansion. In general, the subway density of each block decreases with the increase of distance between the block of interest and urban center. Both air quality and subway datasets are aggregated to the monitor and daily level. We also included daily weather variables, including daily maximum and minimum temperature, average wind speed, and binary variables, indicating rain or snow and the same wind direction from day to night, as local weather conditions are important determinants of air quality [7] . First, sun and high temperatures can function as catalysts for chemical processes of air pollutants. Second, air pollutants will be removed from the atmosphere by precipitation. In view of the fact that the unit of analysis is based on daily data, we also added a set of time-fixed effects (year, month, weekend, season, and holidays). The meteorological data come from the China Meteorological Administration (CMA). The industrial scale and structure, investment in infrastructure, vehicle fleet, and other socioeconomic factors are not controlled due to their unavailability at monthly or seasonal level.

It could be found that there exist no significant changes in air quality between the treated and untreated subclasses in all pre-opening intervals compared with the base interval. In contrast, we find a significant air pollution improvement effect in all three post-opening intervals in the specification that does not control the monitor-specific time trend. Therefore, the treatment and control group satisfy the parallel trends assumption for DID analysis. Table 3 presents the results from OLS estimates based on Equation (2) (the original regression data and the corresponding estimation codes are available upon request). This analysis seeks to estimate the conditional correlation between subway density and air quality, where columns (1), (2), and (3) report the results of AQI as the dependent variable. We only control weather variables and time-fixed effects in column (1), and the coefficient suggests a positive connection between subway density and air pollution. The main reason may be that areas with a denser network are usually located in the city center, where more pollutants tend to concentrate. After adding the monitor fixed effect in columns (2) and (3), this positive correlation disappears. Considering the endogeneity of subway line location (i.e., subway locations are usually closely related to economic activities), column (3) adds monitor-specific time trends to the specification. The downward bias may be generated in the absence of this control variable, and the difference of estimated results in columns (1) and (2) has confirmed it. We see that the magnitude of subways on air quality, \u03b8 1 , is about \u22120.071 and is different from zero at the 1% level after controlling the monitor-specific trends.

These estimates are broadly consistent with the inspection of Table 4 : subway expansions have a negative effect on air pollution levels during each 40 or longer day period following a subway opening. In the short term, commuters may need some time to switch to rail transit, which results in a positive subway effect on air pollution. When extending the time window to 40 days, the subway effect on air pollution starts to be negative; however, this effect fades away during the 120-day and longer post-opening. With the improvement of Nanjing's subway, the daily average passenger volume by subway had reached 1.47 million in 2014 and 3.07 million in 2018, which has more than doubled within four years. While, during the 4 years (2014-2018), Nanjing incremental private vehicles were 586,890, reached 2.07 million in 2018, and the population experienced slow growth during the 4-year period. This implies that the reincorporation of these latent drivers is likely to counteract the substitution of auto trips for public transit trips and improvements in air quality. Therefore, we infer that improved transit due to the subway expansion may induce some latent drivers to travel by cars, which weakens the subway effect on air pollution reduction in the long term.

We can find that AQI shows a relatively stable trend within a day: a slow upward trend from 6:00 to 12:00 am may result from the increase of CO, PM 10 , and PM 2.5 concentrations in the same period. Moreover, the CO concentration have shown a volatile trend, and its daily maximum pollution level typically occurs at about 9:00 am, which synchronizes with rush hour periods. This trend reflects the contribution of tailpipe emissions to the deterioration of air quality. For the NO 2 , we can see a downward trend from 8:00 am to 3:00 pm, and an upward trend from 4:00 pm to 2:00 am. As the NO 2 concentration is closely associated with vehicle emissions and industrial production activities, its variation keeps pace with commuting and factory emissions at night. PM 10 and PM 2.5 show a similar trend within a day, that is a slow increase during the 6:00 to 10:00 am and 4:00 to 11:00 pm stretch, which suggests their response to the morning and afternoon travel peak. The minimum PM 2.5 and NO 2 recorded in the afternoon may result from the comprehensive effect of photosynthesis of plants, meteorological factors, and commuting time. The O 3 experiences a down and up changing trend, and the peak values appear at about 7:00 pm-this is more likely related to its generation process that we discussed above [28] . As the main contributor to SO 2 is industrial emission, it will not show any time-varying characteristics; hence, SO 2 is the least volatile air pollutant. Based on the descriptive analysis above, we estimate Equation (3) for three different time intervals in a day (i.e., subway service time: 6:00 am to 11:00 pm, travel peak time: 7:00 to 9:00 am and 5:00 to 7:00 pm, and subway out of service time: 1:00 to 5:00 am). The results are reported in Table 6 , from where we can find that the negative subway effect on air pollution still works, except for NO 2 and O 3 . The subway opening causes a statistically significant reduction in PM 2.5 and CO concentration, which are also the major components of vehicle exhausts. This finding is consistent with Wei's [29] estimation results using panel data of 16 major cities in China from 2014 to 2017. This reduction effect is significant both during subway service time and travel peak time, informing us that subway expansion contributes to the reduction in air pollution level.

Commuters' demand for subway is higher during rush hours when pollutant concentrations are also elevated, especially near those major roadways. In contrast, inside of the 1:00 to 5:00 am stretch, the parameters of NO 2 and PM are statistically insignificant. In addition to the subway, demand for buses is also higher during rush hour periods accompanied by high congestion, and buses generally emit pollutants at a higher rate than auto travel on a per vehicle-mile basis [14, 15] . Therefore, air pollution levels may be higher within a day during the service time, which may be captured by the DID approach. Our DID analysis focuses on the subway effect on air quality in the shortterm based on the hourly concentration data, which may capture a distinct pattern from the method based on the whole data period. Columns (2), (8), (14) , and (20) of Table 6 show that subway expansion is associated with a statistically insignificant decrease of PM 10 concentrations, which further confirms this assumption. In terms of the O 3 , the positive coefficient is related to its generation process that has been described above. The insignificant coefficient of SO 2 also confirms the findings in the descriptive analysis above. One concern with our research design may be that the subway opening is picking up other systematic unobservable variables. We should not see a significant reduction effect when the subway is out of service, and we probed this claim via a placebo test.

Elasticity represents the sensitivity of mortality to a one-unit change in air quality. Since its estimate is not the focus of interest in this study, we use the estimates from existing researches on the effect of air pollution on human health. Since the impacts of air pollution on human health vary over time, researches in this field based on data from earlier years may be less effective as the reference. Moreover, considering the credit of estimates based on quasi-experimental studies compared with those based on associated regression models [32] , we used Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, and other databases to identify academic articles and book chapters that meet these criteria, and it could be found that eligible articles in this field are not that rich. Finally, Fan et al. [33] found that a 10 \u00b5g/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 resulted in a 2.2 percent increase in mortality rate based on a Regression Discontinuity (RD) analysis, and He et al. [34] proposed that this rate can reach over 3.25 percent through an estimation of the effect of straw burning on air pollution and health in China, and these were chosen as two main references.

However, the one-size-fits-all approach, such as the driving restriction policy and the license-plate lottery policy, should be avoided during this process. Otherwise, these executive orders may distort consumers' behaviors of purchasing cars and lead to a skewed distribution of high-polluting vehicles [35] and restrain residents' travel demand, hence resulting in a decrease in social welfare [36] . Moreover, wider road surface area for bicycle lanes encourages daily exercise by cycling from home to school or work or by walking to and between stations of public transportation, all of which contribute to reducing urban traffic and air pollution as well as improving individual health. In addition to the expansion of the road surface area, providing changes to public traffic in the periphery of Nanjing by park and ride facilities with charging stations for electric cars and serving larger areas with attractive parking places for bikes at metro stations can be considered to fully unlock the subway's potential to reduce pollution, as these measures could also reduce commuting by car to and from suburbs and surrounding areas, and thereby reduce air pollution.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 726, "end": 730, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 818, "end": 822, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Policy Implications"}, {"text": "Third, other modes of public transport, such as shared bikes, should be encouraged to connect subway stations and destinations, ultimately forming a synthesis transportation system.

However, it is hard to know the specific effectiveness or benefits of this measure without the information regarding the magnitude of air quality improvement caused by public transportation. Previous research in this area, in general, focuses more on the congestion relief function of public transport [11, 12, 39] , and less research has been devoted to understanding the subway effect on air pollution. This paper took both short-term and long-term effects of subway expansion on local air quality into consideration based on a network density-based time series analysis, and a distance-based DID approach with a 60-day window. Different from previous research of similar topics which mainly focused on first-tier cities in China [40, 41] , this study chose Nanjing, a medium-sized city, as our study area, which allowed us to have a comprehensive understanding of the pollution abatement effect of subway expansions. To shed light on how subway expansion is affecting local air quality, we used daily and hourly monitorlevel air quality data on Nanjing from 13 May 2014 to 31 December 2018, combining with corresponding weather variables. We examined the change in air pollution concentration caused by the 8 new subway lines during the sample period in Nanjing. The results showed that there existed a positive effect of subway expansion on local air quality, specifically air pollution level experienced a 3.93% larger reduction in the areas close to subway lines. This decline is similar to the result of Gendron-Carrier et al. [7] based on the analysis of 39 cities across the world with aerosol optical depth (AOD) from satellites as the air quality indicator. However, this effect was inconsistent among different types of air pollutants: the pollution abatement effect is more significant in terms of PM 2.5 and CO. Chen and Whalley's [6] analysis with Taipei as the case study also found a significant reduction in carbon monoxide due to the opening of the Taipei Metro. Liang et al.'s [18] research based on 14 Chinese cities also confirmed the significant reduction in CO and particulate concentrations following a subway system opening. A back-of-the-envelope analysis of the health benefits from this air improvement showed that the total number of yearly averted premature deaths is around 300,214 to 443,498. The reduced mortality is larger than that in Liang et al.'s [18] work, who set the environmental effects of the subway in Beijing as the benchmark when calculating the potential health benefits.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 492, "end": 496, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 497, "end": 500, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 501, "end": 504, "text": "39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 922, "end": 926, "text": "[40,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 927, "end": 930, "text": "41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1724, "end": 1727, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2035, "end": 2038, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2187, "end": 2191, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2576, "end": 2580, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "This study confirms the environmental effects of subway expansions across urban areas in China.

Since the data period in this study is relatively short, future research could further extend the data period and examine the environmental effect of subway expansion within a longer time period. The non-linear effect of subway expansion on air quality may occur in the long run, so the corresponding analysis of non-linear models could be considered. Besides, future research could also examine the impact of subway expansion on health outcomes directly to analyze the role of underlying health conditions in the choice of travel mode. Obtaining reliable and high-frequency data on mortality and the impact of exposure to air pollution on mortality in different cities, combining with the unique traffic patterns, geography, and economic structures of them, would contribute to a more credible estimation of the health benefits of subway expansion in future research.
