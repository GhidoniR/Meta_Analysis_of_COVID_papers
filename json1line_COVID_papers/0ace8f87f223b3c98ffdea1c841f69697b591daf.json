Federal health officials reserve a portion of those doses for federal vaccination efforts, such as the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Bureau of Prisons, as well as a small emergency reserve. Doses are then allocated through two principal channels. 7 Most are directed to states, on a pro rata basis according to their share of the U.S. adult population.

Additional doses are directed to the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program. Currently, doses are allocated to pharmacy partners in each CDC jurisdiction-the states, territories, and large cities that have relationships with CDC-on the basis of population, thereby bringing additional vaccine availability to states indirectly. The retail pharmacy partners serving a given jurisdiction determine which of their retail locations will receive vaccine doses; the CDC's description of the program states that pharmacy partners make those determination based on factors including \"including equitable access, demand, supply, and market saturation\" (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021b).The Federal Retail Pharmacy Program was created to ensure wide access to vaccines, complementing and expanding upon state-supported vaccination sites.
