Moreover, experimentally induced isolation would be brief, relative to the human lifespan, and for ethical reasons, human participants (unlike rodents) would be able to predict when the isolation would end. In all, the first challenge of this research was to develop an experimental induction of objective isolation 10 that created the subjective experience of unmet social needs in human participants. To address this challenge, we had socially-connected healthy human adults spend ten hours (9 am to 7 pm) alone, with no social interaction and no other social stimulation (e.g. social media, email, fiction). We used self-report questionnaires to assess people's resulting subjective experience of loneliness and social craving. 15 After ten hours of social isolation, participants reported substantially increased social craving (t(39)=5.00, p<0.001), loneliness (t(39)=5.17, p<0.001), discomfort (t(39)=5.57, p<0.001) and dislike of isolation t(39)=4.13, p<0.001), and decreased happiness (t(39)=-4.21, p<0.001) compared to when they started isolation. Thirty-six out of forty individual participants reported 20 feeling more lonely after isolation.

Thus, both forms of abstinence evoked craving for the specifically deprived need, along with general discomfort and 25 decreased happiness.

SN/VTA includes almost 30 exclusively dopaminergic neurons, which respond with phasic firing to motivationally relevant cues (see 28 for review) and is activated by craving for food and for drugs of addiction [25] [26] [27] . Using a cue-induced craving task, we found that SN/VTA responded more to food cues after fasting and more to social cues after isolation. That is, although participants reported general discomfort and reduced happiness after both fasting and isolation, SN/VTA responses were selective to the deprived cue. The magnitude of SN/VTA response varied across participants, and was correlated 5 with self-reported craving for the corresponding cue: SN/VTA responses to food cues were correlated with self-reported craving for food (in all sessions), and SN/VTA responses to social cues were correlated with self-reported craving for social contact (also in all sessions). These results fit with the intuitive prediction that the deprivation of a need causes increased craving for the specific need 33 . The specific cravings evoke a generalizable pattern of activity in SN/VTA: 10 patterns of response in SN/VTA in response to food when hungry were more similar to the pattern of response to social cues when isolated than to responses to food when sated. Thus, a common signal at the core of the \"craving circuit\" in the SN/VTA responds selectively to motivationally salient deprived cues, independent of their specific content. 15 By contrast, food and social craving led to dissociable responses almost everywhere else in the brain. Both whole brain and exploratory ROI analyses revealed that food craving evokes selective responses in anterior cingulate cortex and (less reliably) in insula and amygdala but not in orbitofrontal cortex, while social craving evokes selective responses in orbitofrontal cortex but not anterior cingulate cortex, insula or amygdala. Even in the striatum, the major target of 20 dopaminergic projections from SN/VTA, craving for food and social contact were spatially dissociated. Fasting enhanced responses to food cues mostly in nucleus accumbens, whereas isolation enhanced response to social cues mostly in the caudate nucleus. Caudate nucleus activity during social craving is consistent with prior evidence of caudate activity when people re-live experiences of rejection by a significant other 34, for meta-analysis .

An unexpected finding of our study was that, compared to the baseline (no deprivation) session, neural activity for the non-deprived need was decreased, rather than activity for the deprived need being selectively increased. This pattern of narrowing activity was observed for both food and social cues. For example, the midbrain response to food cues was highest after fasting, slightly but not significantly lower at baseline, 10 and lowest after social isolation and eating to satiety. Putamen and nucleus accumbens responses to food cues were the same: not significantly higher after fasting than baseline, but significantly lower after isolation. These results fit with previous fMRI studies that find increased activity in midbrain and the \"craving circuit\" (i.e., striatum, OFC, ACC, amygdala and insula) in response to food cues after fasting compared to carefully induced satiety (e.g., 25, 35, 36 ), but not reliably 15 when compared to baseline (e.g., [37] [38] [39] ). Here we observed a similar pattern for social craving: midbrain responses to social cues were highest after isolation, slightly but not significantly lower at baseline, and lowest after fasting.

Responses in the passive cue-induced craving task could also be influenced by low-level processes like increased visual attention to the deprived category (though the robust prior literature in both humans and animals makes visual attention an unlikely explanation of SN/VTA engagement 28, for review ). We used two different measures of self-reported craving, and while these were correlated with each other, different craving measures were 30 significantly correlated with SN/VTA activity for food craving and to social craving. Thus, future studies should investigate the changes in subsequent behaviours that are predicted by SN/VTA responses following acute social isolation.

The potential for virtual interactions to fulfill social needs is particularly relevant when large populations are required to self-isolate, for example during a global pandemic.

However, our pre-registered hypotheses focus on the anatomical localization strategy, so we treat analyses of the functionally localized regions as exploratory.15", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF15": {"text": "Behavioral data analysisQuestionnaire data.

On the other hand, these two methods are likely measuring a similar underlying function because the mean activity in response to social cues following isolation was highly correlated across subjects (r(38) = 0.81; p < 0.001), as shown in the scatterplot inFigure S9in 20 the SM.

We selected ROIs based on converging results from five metaanalyses of craving across different modalities 26,84-86 identifying signals of craving in 25 orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula.

Participants selected their food while they were still fasted, and we gave no restrictions for what or how much to order. participants were invited to send us text documents (without any social content) to read or work on during isolation; approved documents were printed or transferred to the provided laptop.

We next used multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to determine whether the multivariate spatial pattern of activity in SN/VTA is shared for food and social craving. From the GLM, we extracted the beta values (i.e., amplitude of the fit hemodynamic response function) of the response to each condition (food cues, social cues, flower cues) for each block in30 each run (3 blocks per condition per run * 6 runs) in each session (baseline, fasting, isolation) resulting in 162 beta values for each voxel. Responses were extracted from all voxels in the anatomically identified SN/VTA in each participant (i.e. no additional feature selection was applied). All multivariate analyses were conducted with the PyMVPA 90 toolbox in Python (http://www.pymvpa.org) and Matlab2019b. While smoothing has been shown to not substantially affect information in multivariate data[91][92][93] , because of the small size of the SN/VTA, we also ran the classification analyses on unsmoothed data and find that we were not able to decode stimulus or motivational state across sessions in the unsmoothed data (seeSupplementary Materials).First, as a proof of concept, we tested if we could classify food cues from control cues from the SN/VTA within the food fasting session (see Supplementary Materials). Then, we10 trained a linear SVM classifier, training using all 36 betas (2 cues * 3 blocks * 6 runs) of the food fasting session to discriminate patterns of responses to food vs flower cues (see Supplementary Materials for within-session decoding accuracies for food cues). We tested the generalization of the classifier to responses to social vs flower cues in the isolation session (i.e., different category of cue but similar motivational state), producing an accuracy score (correct 15 classification for 36 betas). If social craving and food craving share a neural basis, we predicted that a classifier trained on food_craved vs control cues would successfully (above chance) classify social_craved vs control cues. We also tested the generalization of this classifier to food vs flower cues, in the isolation and baseline sessions (i.e., the same categories of cues as the training, but different motivational state), and to social vs flower cues at baseline (i.e., different20 category and different motivational state, as a control analysis). In order to obtain confidence intervals of the mean in the data samples we used bootstrapping. We generated 1000 datasets randomly by sampling with replacement from the classification accuracies across participants using Matlab's bootci function.For hypothesis testing on the group level, we used a permutation analysis following the25 methods in Stelzer et al. 201394 . This non-parametric approach does not depend on assumptions about the distribution of classification accuracies94,95 . To generate a null distribution from the data, we followed the steps described in Stelzer et al., which we summarize below and visualize infigure 4. We shuffled the condition labels randomly during training within each run, and then tested the prediction accuracies for each cross-classification on the test data. We performed this30 permutation analysis 100 times per participant (thus creating 100 random permutations) resulting in 100 accuracy values per participant, for each testing data set. To create a null distribution on the group level, we then randomly drew one of the 100 accuracy values for each participant, and calculated a mean across participants. This procedure was repeated 10 5 times for each testing data set, creating the null distributions for each data set (seefigure 4for the histograms showing the null distributions). We calculated the probability p of obtaining a mean accuracy value in the null distributions that is equal to or higher than the true mean from the analyses. Following Stelzer et al., we rejected the null hypothesis of no group-level decoding if p < 0.001 which corresponds to a low probability if it were retrieved by chance.Finally, we used representational similarity analysis to test which pattern of activity is more similar to 'food_craved': social_craved or food_noncraved. We predicted that the presence10 of a craved object should be more important for SN/VTA activity than the cue category, so we predicted that the pattern of food_craved responses will be more similar to the pattern of response to social_craved cues, compared to when these cues are presented in different motivational states (social_craved x food_noncraved) or even the same cue in different motivational states (food_craved x food_noncraved) . We averaged responses to each cue across 15 all 6 runs per session to obtain one mean beta value for each voxel. Then we calculated the dissimilarity (1 -Pearson's correlation, fisher-transformed) between each average response pattern. Then we compared the dissimilarity between food_craved x social_craved (i.e., foodfasted and social-isolated; different stimuli but similar motivational state) to the dissimilarity between food_noncraved x social_craved (i.e., food-baseline and social-isolate; maximally 20 distant (different stimuli, different motivational state and different session -the noise ceiling)", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF5": {"text": ").
