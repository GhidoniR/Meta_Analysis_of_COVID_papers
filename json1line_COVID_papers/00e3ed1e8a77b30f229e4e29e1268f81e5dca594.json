We evaluated 28 effects of endogenous itaconate and exogenous itaconate, dimethyl-, and 4-octyl-itaconate on host 29 responses to influenza A virus infection. Infection induced ACOD1 (the enzyme catalyzing itaconate 30 synthesis) mRNA in monocytes and macrophages, which correlated with viral replication and was 31 abrogated by itaconate treatment. Pulmonary inflammation and weight loss were greater in Acod1 -/-32 than wild-type mice, and ectopic synthesis of itaconate in human epithelial cells reduced infection-33 induced inflammation. The compounds induced different recruitment programs in infected human 34 macrophages, and transcriptome profiling revealed that they reversed infection-triggered interferon 35 responses and modulated inflammation in cell lines, PBMC, and lung tissue. Single-cell RNA 36 sequencing of PBMC revealed that infection induced ACOD1 exclusively in monocytes, whereas 37 treatment silenced IFN-responses in monocytes, lymphocytes, and NK cells. Viral replication did not 38 increase under treatment despite the dramatically repressed IFN responses, but 4-octyl itaconate 39 inhibited viral transcription in PBMC. The results reveal dramatic reprogramming of host responses 40 by itaconate and derivatives and their potential as adjunct treatments for hyperinflammation in viral 41 infection. 42 43", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "ACOD1 mRNA induction was seen in M2 cells and undifferentiated PBMC, and the weakest in 140 M1 cells and dTHP-1 cells (Fig. 2B-E) , even though the latter two cell types did support a 141 significant degree of viral transcription ( Fig. 2A,D) . As in IAV-infected mouse lung (Fig. 1) , 142 TNFAIP3 and ACOD1 transcriptional correlated with each other (Fig. 2C) . Infection of dTHP-1 143 cells with three IAV (H1N1) strains of differential replication efficiency (Petersen, Mostafa et al., 144 2018b) showed the strongest ACOD1 and TNFAIP3 induction by the two strains with the highest 145 and the weakest by the strain with the lowest replication efficiency (Fig. 2D,E) . Thus, the extent 146 of ACOD1 induction after IAV infection differed significantly among the cell types tested, was 147 strongest in M2 primary cells, was accompanied in all cases by an increase in TNFAIP3 mRNA, 148 and correlated with viral replication. 150 RNA replication. We then tested whether these compounds could modulate cellular 151 inflammation due to IAV infection. In infected dTHP-1 cells, treatments with itaconate or DI did 152 not affect viral hemagglutinin (HA) mRNA expression, but both reduced induction of CXCL10, a 153 key pro-inflammatory chemokine during influenza virus infection, with DI being several-fold 154 more potent (Fig. 3B,C, Fig. S1 ). The 12 h time point was chosen because our previous work had Fig. 3G) . Strikingly, addition of both 162 itaconate and DI led to global down-regulation of IFN-regulated genes. This was accompanied by 163 upregulation of a substantial number of other transcripts, indicating that the compounds also 164 modulated other cellular processes (Fig. 3H,I) . A principle component analysis (PCA) indicated 165 that effects of the compounds on the cells were so pronounced at these concentrations that treated 166 infected and treated uninfected cells clustered closely together, but far away from untreated 167 infected or uninfected cells (Fig. S2) . Indeed, a hierarchical clustering analysis revealed an 168 across-the-board normalization of a clade of IFN-and inflammation-related transcripts by the compounds, but also clusters of DEGs that were upregulated by either or both compounds with 170 respect to both uninfected and infected cells, further indicating effects upon cell homeostasis in 171 general (Fig. S3) . mRNA and protein expression may be differentially affected by IAV infection 172 due to virus-induced \"host-cell shut-off\". We therefore assessed release of inflammation-related 173 polypeptides in supernatants from the same experiment (Fig. 3J) . This analysis confirmed the 174 downregulation of pro-inflammatory factors (e.g., IP-10, MCP-1) by itaconate and DI, but also 175 showed increased IL-8 (DI only) and minor increases of IL1B (both IA and DI) in uninfected 176 cells. Of note, both compounds also increased levels of the anti-inflammatory IL1 receptor 177 antagonist (IL1RA) in supernatants from both infected and uninfected cells. A comprehensive 178 view of the protein targets that were detected by this assay revealed that the two compounds 179 effected substantially different changes in the target cells, as several factors were induced even in 180 uninfected cells specifically by DI or itaconate (Fig. S4) . Thus, itaconate and DI apparently act 181 on macrophages to release different recruitment programs that modify local inflammatory cell 182 populations. 183 Analysis of enriched GO terms revealed that IFN-I signaling was strongly induced in the infected 184 cells, which was prevented by treatment with itaconate and DI (Fig. 4) . This analysis also 185 revealed that both compounds activated metabolic processes, whereas itaconate also modulated 186 processes relating to differentiation and membrane signaling. A KEGG pathway analysis 187 additionally revealed induction of classic pro-inflammatory pathways such as TNF signaling, 188 TLR receptor signaling, and chemokine signaling by infection, all of which were depleted by 189 itaconate and DI treatment (Fig. S5) . Taken together, these results revealed strong anti- IFN and 190 anti-inflammatory effects of itaconate and DI, but also suggested that they exert other important 191 effects on cell metabolism and differentiation, some of which differ between the compounds. (Fig. 5A) , which was accompanied by appearance of substantial concentrations of IA (Fig. 5B) . While there was no effect on viral HA mRNA expression, 200 transfection with the ACOD1-expressing vector led to a marked reduction in infection-associated 201 CXCL10 induction (Fig. 5C,D) . A preliminary treatment experiment showed that (as opposed to 202 THP-1 cells) DI was cytotoxic at 1.0 mM in A549 cells, and the 0.5 mM concentration was 203 therefore used. Treatment with DI resulted in a modest reduction of HA expression early in 204 infection and a marked reduction of CXCL10, IL6, and IFNB expression (Fig. 5E-H) . Exogenous 205 itaconate, too, reduced CXCL10 mRNA, but less efficiently (Fig. S6) . Taken together, these 206 results obtained with A549 cells suggest that immunomodulatory effects of itaconate and DI are 207 independent of the ability of the cell type to express endogenous ACOD1, and that similar effects 208 on IFN-directed gene expression can be obtained with ectopic, endogenous synthesis of itaconate 209 and exogenously added itaconate and DI. 210 Next, we assessed effects of itaconate and DI on cellular transcriptomes in IAV-infected A549 211 cells. PCA revealed the expected normalization of gene expression due to DI treatment, but also 212 increasing effects of the compounds on overall cell homeostasis (Fig. S7) . As in THP-1 cells, 213 hierarchical clustering analysis revealed clear clustering of each of the four groups and the close 214 relationship of the uninfected and DI-treated infected cells (Fig. S8) . However, the anti-215 inflammatory effect of itaconate was weaker than that of DI, and at the higher (40 mM) 216 concentration, the itaconate signature became so dominant that the itaconate-treated infected 217 group now formed its own clade (Fig. S9) . IAV infection enriched GO terms related to IFN-I and 218 -II responses as well as other antiviral and pro-inflammatory terms, which could all be reduced to 219 near baseline by treatment with DI or itaconate (Fig. 6) . Visualization of differentially expressed 220 IFN-related mRNA also showed that, in spite of its overall lower effect on pro-inflammatory 221 signaling than DI, itaconate treatment at the lower (20 mM) concentration did have a 222 considerable impact on IFN-I expression (Fig 6B) . In addition, itaconate uniquely inhibited 223 NFKB signaling and fatty acid metabolism. KEGG-pathway analysis additionally revealed 224 depletion of other pro-inflammatory pathways, including TNF signaling and necroptosis, by the 225 treatments (Fig. S10) . (Fig. S11) , whereas ACOD1 mRNA levels did 231 not change significantly. Adding itaconate and DI reduced expression of CXCL10 mRNA in 232 tissue and IP10 protein in culture supernatant, and itaconate additionally reduced ISG15 mRNA 233 in tissue, whereas viral titers in the supernatant were unaffected (Fig. 7) . Re-analysis of a 234 published dataset from a model using a different IAV strain (H3N2) and histologically normal inflammatory response both at the mRNA and protein level (Fig. 8A,B) . The induction of 246 ACOD1 mRNA expression in peripheral blood in IAV infection was also corroborated by 247 reanalysis of a published dataset from whole blood from patients with moderate and severe 248 influenza (Fig. S13) . The effects of itaconate were mixed in that there was no significant change 249 in ACOD1, IFNB1, and TNF mRNA expression in cells or of IL1B protein in supernatants. In 250 contrast, DI and 4OI led to a marked reduction of IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression 251 at the mRNA and protein level, as well as of ACOD1 mRNA. As exemplified by the effect of DI 252 and 4OI on TNF and ACOD1 expression, the treatments reduced expression of some mRNA 253 targets even in uninfected cells, suggesting that they also reduced some baseline inflammation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 286, "end": 289, "text": "142", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 489, "end": 492, "text": "144", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 884, "end": 887, "text": "148", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 927, "end": 930, "text": "150", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1544, "end": 1547, "text": "163", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1742, "end": 1745, "text": "165", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1845, "end": 1848, "text": "166", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2043, "end": 2046, "text": "168", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2732, "end": 2735, "text": "175", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3438, "end": 3441, "text": "183", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3635, "end": 3638, "text": "185", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3918, "end": 3921, "text": "188", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4109, "end": 4120, "text": "IFN and 190", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4466, "end": 4469, "text": "200", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4663, "end": 4666, "text": "202", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4850, "end": 4853, "text": "204", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5344, "end": 5347, "text": "209", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5388, "end": 5391, "text": "210", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5586, "end": 5589, "text": "212", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5685, "end": 5688, "text": "213", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5975, "end": 5978, "text": "216", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6173, "end": 6176, "text": "218", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6276, "end": 6279, "text": "219", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 118, "end": 129, "text": "(Fig. 2B-E)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 232, "end": 242, "text": "Fig. 2A,D)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 275, "end": 283, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 351, "end": 360, "text": "(Fig. 2C)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 658, "end": 669, "text": "(Fig. 2D,E)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1321, "end": 1340, "text": "(Fig. 3B,C, Fig. S1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1405, "end": 1413, "text": "Fig. 3G)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1681, "end": 1692, "text": "(Fig. 3H,I)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1976, "end": 1985, "text": "(Fig. S2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2347, "end": 2356, "text": "(Fig. S3)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2594, "end": 2603, "text": "(Fig. 3J)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3274, "end": 3283, "text": "(Fig. S4)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3605, "end": 3613, "text": "(Fig. 4)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4045, "end": 4054, "text": "(Fig. S5)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4315, "end": 4324, "text": "(Fig. 5A)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4399, "end": 4408, "text": "(Fig. 5B)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4587, "end": 4598, "text": "(Fig. 5C,D)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4923, "end": 4934, "text": "(Fig. 5E-H)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5009, "end": 5018, "text": "(Fig. S6)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5654, "end": 5663, "text": "(Fig. S7)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5854, "end": 5863, "text": "(Fig. S8)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6108, "end": 6117, "text": "(Fig. S9)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6328, "end": 6336, "text": "(Fig. 6)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6610, "end": 6618, "text": "(Fig 6B)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6866, "end": 6876, "text": "(Fig. S10)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6879, "end": 6889, "text": "(Fig. S11)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7182, "end": 7190, "text": "(Fig. 7)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7364, "end": 7375, "text": "(Fig. 8A,B)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7591, "end": 7601, "text": "(Fig. S13)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Of note, 4OI in addition led to a pronounced (95%) reduction in HA transcription (p=<0.0001), 255 indicating inhibition of viral RNA replication. PCA of bulk PBMC transcriptomes revealed 256 strong effects of the compounds on cell transcriptomes in general, which led to one outlying DI-257 treated sample and two itaconate-treated samples, whereas all four 4OI-treated samples formed a 258 clearly discernible group (Fig. S14) . The most significant transcriptome changes were driven by 4OI, which had major effects on many genes that were not regulated by IAV infection or 260 itaconate or DI treatments (Fig. S15) . Nonetheless, induction of HMOX1 by DI in IAV-infected 261 samples was evident. Functional enrichment analysis of GO terms based on the transcriptomes 262 revealed that infection induced the expected antiviral responses, including response to IFN-I, as 263 well as several other inflammation-related terms (Fig. 8C) . At least one of the three compounds 264 prevented activation of each of the infection-associated terms. However, consistent with its lack 265 of effect on IFNB expression (Fig. 8) , itaconate did not affect response to IFN-I or influenza A. 266 Several terms that were depleted by the compounds in infected PBMC were not enriched by 267 infection alone, suggesting that the compounds diminished also a baseline activation of the 268 PBMC. Interestingly, 4OI treatment strongly enriched terms relating to chromatin conformation, 269 which turned out to be driven by upregulation of histone deacetylase epression. A KEGG 270 pathway analysis essentially confirmed the findings of the GO term analysis (Fig. S16) (Fig. 9A,B) . Monocytes constituted the least numerous cell type, and DI treatment of 282 control and infected cells led to a further reduction (Fig. S17) . It was not possible to discern 283 whether this was due to decreased survival or a technical artefact. Monocytes were essentially the 284 only cell type expressing viral RNA, as only negligible amounts of viral transcripts were detected 285 in lymphocytes and NK cells. DI treatment appeared to result in a slight increase in viral RNA 286 expression in monocytes (Fig. 9C) . IAV infection upregulated expression of ACOD1 exclusively, 287 and CXCL10 predominantly, in monocytes, whereas TNFAIP3, IFIT1, and ISG15 were 288 upregulated also in the NK, T and B cell compartments (Fig. 9D) . DI treatment markedly reduced expression of ACOD1, IFIT1, and CXCL10, but -interestinglyit reduced TNFAIP3 and ISG15 290 (albeit weakly) expression only in monocytes. Consistent with the observation that they 291 constituted the main PBMC host cell, IAV infection triggered the most vigorous transcriptomic 292 host response in monocytes, which was driven by the expected IFN responses (Fig. 9E) . 293 However, discernable differential expression (mostly of IFN-related RNAs) was also observed in 294 the other cell types. CD8+ T cells are shown as a representative example in Fig. 9F , the other cell preferential effect on monocytes became apparent (Fig. 9G,H) . 302 GO term enrichment analysis of the monocyte scRNAseq data confirmed the major enrichment of 303 IFN-related processes by infection and their depletion by DI treatment, which had been seen in 304 all models in this study. In addition, infection broadly dampened RNA metabolism, ribosome 305 assembly, and protein synthesis and export, which was consistent with the cytostatic effects of 306 type I IFN. DI treatment reversed all these effects and also stimulated some in uninfected cells 307 (Fig. 10A) . A KEGG enrichment analysis of these monocyte data confirmed the depletion of 308 IFN-related pathways (influenza, measles, cytosolic DNA sensing pathway) by DI treatment, but 309 also of other pro-inflammatory pathways (TLR signaling, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, 310 NF-kB signaling) in infected and uninfected cells (Fig. S19) .

Thus, induction of 401 ACOD1 expression (and thereby itaconate synthesis) likely is a common feature in human 402 influenza. We have recently identified the active center of ACOD1 enzyme and found that 403 naturally occurring loss-of-function mutations are extremely rare, suggesting that physiologic 404 itaconate responses have been important in human evolution (Chen et al., 2019).

The impact of itaconate and DI treatments on cell transcriptomes is greater than 772 that of IAV infection. PCA based on the microarray analysis shown in Fig. 3. Untreated and 773 treated IAV-infected cells cluster together, whereas untreated infected cells are clearly separated 774 from all other groups in both principle components. A.

Analysis based on the same microarray data as used for Fig. 3 and EV1B, using 777 the top 100 DEGs (FDR F-test <1.89E-09). Uninfected cells and untreated IAV-infected cells 778 form one clade and itaconate and DI treated IAV-infected cells the other clade. The brackets 779 identify (i) a large pro-inflammatory subclade in IAV infection, which is globally downregulated 780 by the treatments; (ii) a large cluster of DEGs specific for itaconate treatment; (iii) a small cluster 781 of DEGs specific for DI treatment, and (iv) a subclade comprising DEGs differentially expressed due to both compounds. B. Enrichment plots based on the 99 genes contained in GO term 783 Response to type I interferon. Enrichment scores are plotted on the y-axis, the mRNAs 784 (identified by vertical lines) along the x-axis, ranked by fold change. The plots illustrate 785 pronounced enrichment in a large number of genes due to infection, which is nearly 786 quantitatively depleted by treatment with both itaconate and DI. Itaconate and DI induce different recruitment programs in dTHP1 cells. 788 Supernatants of uninfected and IAV-infected dTHP1 cells, with our without itaconate or DI 789 treatment, were analyzed for concentrations of 27 cytokines/chemokines by multiplex microbead 790 array 12 h after infection or mock treatment. A hierarchical clustering analysis was carried out 791 with those targets that were detected above limit of detection of the assay in most samples. The 792 microarray analysis of cellular gene expression from the same experiment is shown in Fig. KEGG-pathway analysis of effects of itaconate and DI treatment on IAV-795 infected dTHP-1 cells. Analysis based on the microarray data set used for Figure 4. A broad 796 dampening of IFN-related and pro-inflammatory pathways by both compounds is evident. Effects of increasing doses of itaconate and DI on CXCL10 expression in IAV-798 infected A549 cells. RT-qPCR using HPRT1 as reference. A549 cells were infected with IAV 799 and itaconate and DI treatments were given at the indicated concentrations. Expression of HA and 800 CXCL10 mRNA was measured by RT-qPCR 24 h p.i. (n=3). DI concentrations \u2265 1 mM could not 801 be evaluated due to widespread cytotoxicity seen by light microscopy. Global effects of itaconate and DI on transcriptomic responses in IAV-infected 803 A549 cells. PCA based on the microarray analysis used for Fig. 6, but additionally including 804 treatments with 40 mM itaconate and 0.25 mM DI. PCA showing normalization of IAV-driven 805 reprogramming of gene expression, but increasing impact of itaconate on cellular responses with 806 increasing doses. Effects of itaconate (20 mM) and DI (0.5 mM) on transcriptomic responses in 808 IAV-infected A549 cells. Analysis based on the microarray data used for the GO analysis in Fig. 809 6. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of the 100 most significant DEGs (FDR F-test <1.46E-10). DI-treated infected and uninfected cells cluster in one clade, and infected and 811 itaconate-treated infected cells in the other. There is a large clade mostly containing 812 proinflammatory genes, which are downregulated by DI, whereas effects of itaconate are much 813 weaker. DUSP95 is exclusively downregulated by itaconate (arrowhead). There are two smaller 814 clades of genes that form an \"itaconate signature\", comprising genes that are, albeit to a lesser 815 extent, also upregulated by IAV infection, or uniquely by itaconate. Effects of itaconate (40 mM) and DI (0.5 mM) on transcriptomic responses in 817 IAV-infected A549 cells. Hierarchical clustering analysis ased on the microarray analysis used 818 for Fig. S5. Compared to the 20 mM itaconate concentration (Fig. S8), itaconate-treated IAV 819 infection is now in a separate clade, indicating that the impact of itaconate on the cells dominates 820 that of the infection. Downregulation of the inflammation-driven clade is now more pronounced, 821 the itaconate-unique signature is stronger, and there also is a clade comprised of genes 822 downregulated by IAV. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of itaconate (20 mM) and DI (0.5 mM) 824 treatment on IAV infection in A549 cells. Analysis performed based on the microarray data 825 shown in Fig. 6 and S8. Primary human lung tissue explants support IAV RNA transcription and 827 upregulation of CXCL10 mRNA. Human primary lung tissue from patients with emphysema or 828 pulmonary arterial hypertension (n=7 donors, 3 tissue pieces per donor per treatment) was 829 infected with IAV for 72 h and HA and CXCL10 mRNA expression measured by RT-qPCR, 830 using HPRT1 as internal reference. CXCL10 levels are expressed as fold change with reference to 831 uninfected tissue at the same time point. *p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.MannInduction of ACOD1 and TNFAIP3 mRNAs during IAV (H3N2) infection of 834 human lung explants.

Analysis of mRNA expression in a subgroup (n=4) 847 of the PBMC samples that were used for the targeted assays shown in Fig. 8. A PCA was 848 performed on the same oligonucleotide microarray data as used for Fig. 8C and J. There is a less 849 pronounced effect of IAV infection (control and IAV infected samples are not clearly separated) 850 than on dTHP-1 and A549 cells, but pronounced additional broad changes in gene expression due 851 to treatment with 4OI, itaconate treatment (note two outliers), and DI (one outlier). Hierarchical clustering analysis of transcriptomic changes in IAV infected 853 PBMC and responses to itaconate, DI, and 4OI treatment. The 100 most significant DEGs 854 were selected (FDR F-test <3.72E-05). Transcriptome changes are mostly due to marked effects 855 of 4OI (more down-than upregulation) on genes that are not affected by IAV infection, 856 indicating general effects on cell homeostasis.

RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), RNA quality was checked with a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies) and samples with RNA integrity number >7 were used for microarray analysis. Total RNA/Poly-A RNA Control Mixture was prepared by adding poly-A RNA controls (Affymetrix). This poly-A RNA was then used to prepare double standard cDNA. Antisense RNA (complimentary RNA or cRNA) was then synthesized and amplified by in vitro transcription (IVT) of the ds-cDNA template using T7 RNA polymerase. Enzymes, salts, inorganic phosphates, and unincorporated nucleotides were removed to prepare the cRNA for 2nd-cycle ds-cDNA synthesis. After verifying quality and yield of cRNA, sense-strand cDNA was synthesized by the reverse transcription of cRNA. cRNA template was hydrolyzed leaving ds-cDNA, which was then purified. cDNA was fragmented andlabeled by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) using the Affymetrix proprietary DNA Labeling Reagent that is covalently linked to biotin.

Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 2x50 pairedend kits using the following read length: 26 bp Read1 for cell barcode and UMI, 8 bp I7 index for sample index and 89 bp Read2 for transcript. Cell Ranger 1.3 (http://10xgenomics.com) was used to process Chromium single-cell 3' RNA-seq output. First, \"cellranger mkfastq\" demultiplexed the sequencing samples based on the 8bp sample index read to generate fastq files for the Read1 and Read2, followed by extraction of 16bp cell barcode and 10bp UMI. Second, \"cellranger count\" aligned the Read2 to the pre-built human reference genome (hg19, GRCh38) using STAR. Then, aligned reads were used to generate data matrix only when they had valid barcodes and UMI, and mapped to exons (Ensembl GTFs GRCm38.p4) without PCR duplicates.Valid cell barcodes were defined based on UMI distribution.Single-cell gene expression data analysis including filtering, normalization, and clustering was processed using Seurat V3.1 (https://satijalab.org/seurat/) in the R environment (www.bioconductor). Cells were removed when they had < 500 genes and > 25% reads mapped to mitochondrial expression genome. After filtering and doublet removal, 6456 single cells597 (control = 1870, DI =1474, IAV=1701, IAV & DI= 1411) remained. Raw counts were normalized by the global-scaling normalization method \"LogNormalize\". Principal component analysis score was used to determine the 'dimensionality' of all cells. Scatter plots were obtained using the UMAP method. Cell clusters were identified as different cell populations based on the expression of recently published canonical markers (Table 3). Differential gene expression was determined for each cell type using DESeq2 (Love, Huber et al., 2014). IAV infected cells wereidentified by the presence of IAV encoded transcripts, as mapped against NIAID Influenza mRNA markers used to define PBMC cell subpopulations in scRNAseq times, and detection antibody was added to each well.
