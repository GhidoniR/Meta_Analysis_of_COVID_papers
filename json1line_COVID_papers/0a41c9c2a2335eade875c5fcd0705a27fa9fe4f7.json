However, it is not the fact that a person is assigned male at birth (i.e., they have genital erectile tissue of a certain size) that makes those assigned male at birth have lower FM on average compared with those assigned female at birth. In fact, FM and the distribution of fat may actually be biosocial phenomena: they may depend on both sex AND gender (sex/gender). For example, one effect of larger quantities of testosterone is changes in fat distribution and increases in muscle production, resulting in lower body fat percentages [73] . However, most research into sex differences in body composition do not explore other explanations, such as the differences in diet between men and women in some cultural contexts [36, 61] . The BIA literature also does not disaggregate sociocultural context that might be caught up in the word \"sex\", nor account for the myriad ways in which someone assigned male at birth might not match the presumed physiological composition associated with those assigned male at birth on average.

Wittkower has termed a dysaffordance -they have to pretend to be something they are not in order to access the service [15, 81] . The lack of transparency in the BIA equations makes it difficult to tell exactly what adjustments might need to be made to make equations more inclusive, or to at the least advise individuals as to which \"sex\" they should choose when using consumer technologies that incorporate BIA. On the other hand, the current setup of the Withings scale that asks for user gender may actually produce more accurate results for trans women and trans men who have undergone gender-affirming hormone therapy, as their body composition may resemble that of a cis woman or cis man, rather than their sex assigned at birth [41, 73] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 259, "end": 263, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 803, "end": 807, "text": "[73]", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 989, "end": 993, "text": "[36,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 994, "end": 997, "text": "61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1511, "end": 1515, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1516, "end": 1519, "text": "81]", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 2128, "end": 2132, "text": "[41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2133, "end": 2136, "text": "73]", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Unpacking \"Sex\""}, {"text": "White nonbinary or intersex people, despite experiencing a dysaffordance, may be better off than their siblings of color because the composition of the study populations used in BIA equations in the Withings scale are unclear, and there is no way to enter racial or ethnic information. 2 The majority of measurement studies involving BIA include primarily Caucasian subjects and assume that Caucasian subjects are to serve as a \"reference\" for other ethnicities. 3 This is an issue because body composition can vary among ethnic and racial groups due to the environment, diet, cultural factors, and anthropomorphic measurements such as limb length and body size [19] . Researchers or device manufacturers interested in using BIA equations validated in a Caucasian population therefore need to cross-validate the equations in the population of study.

The vast majority of medical devices, including \"smart\" and \"connected\" devices, are approved through a program at the FDA known as the 510k approval process. This process requires no clinical trials and very little oversight -device manufacturers merely need to prove that their product is \"substantially equivalent\" to that of an already approved medical device. The Withings scale discussed in this paper received 510(k) clearance [1]; similar scales on the market such as the Fitbit Aria scale received approval even after the devices were already on the market [2]. In 2014, the FDA announced their intentions to cease requiring even 510(k) approval for devices such as smart weight scales. This means that there is very little regulation of these devices, and certainly no required clinical validation of the algorithms used to calculate body composition, despite the label of \"clinically tested\" on the Withings website. This lack of regulatory oversight results in most consumerfocused deployments of technologies like BIA being \"black box\" algorithms.

When using the Withings scale, only the final body fat percentage is made available, and there is no explicit reference to an algorithm in the app or in most of the marketing materials. Additionally, Withings does not release the equations its scales use to calculate FFM or the populations that it used to calculate those equations.
