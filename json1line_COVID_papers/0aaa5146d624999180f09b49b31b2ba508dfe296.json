Although most tropical diseases have some type of chemotherapeutic option available, the cost and relative lack of efficacy, coupled often with rapid development of drug resistance, have resulted in unsatisfactory progress in prevention and treatment of these ailments. For the purposes of this review, neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are listed in Table 1 . Several tropical diseases are among the world's biggest killers. Table 2 lists the global disease burden caused by the top five diseases. In addition, amebiasis is endemic in many countries and has been estimated to kill 55,000 people each year, making it one of the top tropical diseases in terms of mortality (Shirley et al., 2018) . The current business model for new drug development favors developed countries with populations or governments able to pay for drugs, allowing the very high development costs (median 2020 cost estimated to be US$1-1.3Bn) to be recouped by companies (Wouters et al., 2020) . This is one of the major reasons why most tropical diseases are \"neglected.\" Given the immense burden of disease, there is clearly an urgent need to develop better treatments for NTDs. One way to achieve this is through the intervention of charitable government funds like the US NIH and DoD, European Union, Medicines for Malaria venture, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Wellcome Trust. One aim of the London Declaration of Neglected Tropical Diseases (Molyneux, 2017) , inspired by the World Health Organization 2020 roadmap to eradicate or prevent transmission for neglected tropical diseases (https://unitingtocombatntds.org/resources/ who-roadmap-ntds/), is to \"advance research and development through partnerships and provision of funding to find treatments and interventions for NTDs. Global warming that increases the range of some NTDs, and the pandemic risk that infectious diseases originating from tropical regions pose, is driving renewed interest and urgency on disease preparedness that includes preemptive development of drugs. These programs and factors should drive increased interest and investment in discovery of drugs for NTDs in the future.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 798, "end": 820, "text": "(Shirley et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 1072, "end": 1094, "text": "(Wouters et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 1561, "end": 1577, "text": "(Molyneux, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 477, "end": 484, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 552, "end": 559, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "NTD drug research is progressing quite strongly using traditional medicinal chemistry discovery methods (see a very recent thematic issue (Ali et al., 2020) ).

AI and ML methods are deployed primarily for ligand-based design or discovery of new therapeutics. Unlike structure-based methods that use experimental structures of target proteins for drug design, ligand-based methods look for patterns in sets of small drug-like molecules that describe how their molecular properties modulate their biological activities. These patterns are described mathematically by the well-established and validated QSAR method. QSAR relies on the observation that similar molecules often exhibit similar biological activities and that changes to chemical structure in a series of drug candidates can be correlated with their biological effects. These mappings between structure and biology can provide both qualitative and quantitative predictions of likely drug potency and may also elucidate mechanisms of action at the molecular level. While the latter was the initial use of QSAR methods, greatly expanded data sets and computational power have seen a shift to using QSAR models to predict the biological and physicochemical properties of extremely diverse chemical libraries where there is no longer a common chemical scaffold. These two important purposes of QSAR have been described in detail in a recent paper by one of the \"fathers\" of the QSAR method, Toshio Fujita (Fujita and Winkler, 2016) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1370, "end": 1396, "text": "(Fujita and Winkler, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "While QSAR was initially a statistical modelling method using linear regression (MLR) and linear logistic regression (LLR), the past three decades have seen greatly expanded application of diverse machine learning methods, principally Gaussian processes (GP), artificial neural networks (ANN) and their Bayesian version (BRANN), support vector machines (SVM, including the SMO implementation) and their Bayesian variant relevance vector machines (RVM), decision trees (DT, including the J48 implementation), random forests (RF) and their variants such as extreme gradient boost (XGBoost), Na\u00efve Bayes (NB), and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) clustering methods. More recently, deep learning (DL) algorithms like deep neural networks (DNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), generalized adversarial networks (GAN), associative neural networks (AsNN), encoder-decoder networks, and recurrent neural networks (RNN) have exhibited very interesting properties useful for modelling structure-activity relationships. The theory behind these methods is complex and outside the scope of the review.
