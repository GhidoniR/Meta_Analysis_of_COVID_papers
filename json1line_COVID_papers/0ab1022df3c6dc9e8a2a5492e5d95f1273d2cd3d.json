Nurses often face huge psychological pressure as a result of workload, long hours, and working in a high-risk environment. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety, depression, and stress among nurses working in northwest Amhara referral hospitals. Methods: Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 25th September to 20th October 2020. A total of 302 nurses were selected using a simple random sampling technique. A structured pretested self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. The data were entered into EpiData version 3 and analyzed using SPSS version 21. A binary logistic regression model was used to compute bivariable and multivariable analyses. Results: The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress among nurses was 69.6%, 55.3%, and 20.5%, respectively. Unavailability of a guideline, fear of infecting family, and having chronic diseases increase the risk of developing anxiety. Nurses who did not have a guideline, received negative feedback from families, had a history of mental disorders, and chronic diseases have a higher odds of depression. Working in the night shift, lack of training, fear of infecting family, negative feedback from families, presence of confirmed/ suspected cases in the family, and having chronic diseases increase the risk of developing stress. Conclusion: More than two-thirds, more than half, and nearly one-fifth of the nurses had anxiety, depression, and stress, respectively. It is better to create awareness for the community, avail a guideline, train nurses, and give special attention to nurses with chronic disease and a history of mental disorders to minimize the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurses and protect their mental health. The government shall develop and implement national programs for occupational health and safety, prevent violence in the workplace, improve psychological well-being, and protect from physical and biological hazards to take care of the mental health of healthcare professionals during this pandemic.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in a seafood and poultry market in the Chinese city of Wuhan in 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) characterized the outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020, as cases have been detected in most countries worldwide. 1 As of August 17, 2020, there have been 21,901,102 laboratory-confirmed coronavirus cases, including 774,299 deaths worldwide according to Johns Hopkins University. The International Council of Nurses (ICN) reported that more than 600 nurses around the world have died from COVID-19 until 3 June 2020. The first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Ethiopia on 13 March 2020 which was the first one to be reported since the beginning of the outbreak in China in December 2019. 2 According to the ministry of health, in Ethiopia there were 31,336 COVID-19 reported cases and 544 (1.74%) deaths in Ethiopia until August 17, 2020.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 328, "end": 329, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 687, "end": 689, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 803, "end": 804, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The pandemic not only affects physical health but also mental health and well-being. 3, 4 Mental health and psychosocial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic may be particularly serious for health professionals because of a higher level of exposure. 5 A poorly known contagious disease outbreak, like COVID-19, leads to unavoidable stress, fear, and anxiety that can be profound among the higher-risk groups, such as healthcare professionals including nurses. 6 The mental well-being of healthcare professionals can be negatively affected by fear of being exposed to the COVID-19 cases in hospitals, being separated from families, and confronting the death or illness of patients from COVID-19. 7, 8 During the pandemic, healthcare professionals (HCPs) are at significant risk of adverse mental health outcomes resulted from limited clinical knowledge about the virus, long working hours, risk of infection, and insufficient provision of protective equipment, loneliness, physical fatigue, and separation from families. 9 Studies conducted during the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) showed that nurses developed serious depressive symptoms. 10 Along with the other HCPs nurses plays a pivotal role in healthcare setup in prevention, infection control, isolation, continuous monitoring of the patients and because of their unique patient-facing nature, there are occupational risks to providing care during the COVID-19 outbreak 11 and it is also reported that the chances of occupational exposure are relatively higher in nurses. 12 Additionally, previous studies have shown that a higher level of anxiety and depression among the nurses due to their long interaction with the patients and the nature of their job. [13] [14] [15] Deprived mental health among nurses may not only be damaging to them but may also affect their professional routine and in turn, the quality of providing patient care 16 as it is evident that the well-being of the mental state is crucial to managing infectious diseases. 9, 17 Nurses often face huge psychological pressure as a result of overwhelming workload, long hours, shift duties, and working in a high-risk environment. 18 Nurses are the frontline healthcare professionals who work across acute care hospitals, long-term care agencies, nursing homes, schools, communities, and government healthcare agencies. The multiple roles and functions played by nurses are particularly important during this COVID-19 pandemic by providing health education, screening services, and support for the general public and individuals in high-risk categories. 19 Estimating the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on nurses is important for health authorities to develop preventive strategies and effective treatment modalities to alleviate its negative outcome. Despite this fact, no studies on the epidemiology of depression, anxiety, and stress in nurses have been conducted in the study area.

Since patients with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness and death, nurses with chronic diseases become more stressed compared with their counterparts. Also, those nurses who had family members/relatives confirmed or suspected for COVID-19 were three times at higher risk of developing stress compared with those who had not. This finding was supported by a study conducted in Wuhan, China. 25 This might be due to nurses may extremely concerned that their family members/relatives might be infected or even die. Nurses become stressed since they lose the possibility to visit their loved ones, cannot contact their family members, and unable to cope with this challenging situation. This study has some limitations. Study participants included in this study were from all departments but the study did not analyze the differences between nurses working in different departments. The study was based on subjective responses using questionnaires that may be prone to reporting bias since it does not incorporate objective measurements. The short duration of the study did not enable us to assess psychological impacts that accumulate over time and have an impact later in the outbreak like posttraumatic stress disorder.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 164, "end": 166, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 933, "end": 935, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "More than two-thirds, more than half, and nearly one-fifth of the nurses had anxiety, depression, and stress in response to the COVID-19 outbreak respectively.
