Methods HER2-positive MBC patients received oral vinorelbine 40 mg thrice a week and trastuzumab (loading dose of 8 mg/kg, followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. The primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR; CR + PR + SD for \u2265 24 weeks). The secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), tolerability, and overall survival (OS). Results Twenty patients with HER2-positive MBC were enrolled, with a median of 1 prior chemotherapy regimens for MBC. Median age was 61.5 years (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 48.6-63.1). Visceral involvements presented in 14 patients (70.0%). ORR was 20.0%, and CBR was 75% with 4 PR (20.0%) and 11 SD (55.0%). The median PFS (mPFS) and median OS (mOS) were 7.4 months (95% CI 3.2-11.5) and 45.8 months (95%CI: not reached), respectively.

The most common grade 1 adverse events (AEs) included nausea (15%), leukopenia (15%), ALT/AST elevation (15%), diarrhea (10%), and peripheral neuropathy (10%). Grade 2 adverse events included leukopenia (5%) and neutropenia (10%). No grade 3/4 AEs were observed.
