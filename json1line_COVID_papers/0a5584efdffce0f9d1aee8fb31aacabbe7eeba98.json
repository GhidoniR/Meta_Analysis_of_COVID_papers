So docking outcomes are constrained by the rigid RNA structure(s) used in the docking, whereas in reality -as we shall see -RNAs are highly fluxional and dynamic molecules that access much structural space. Thus while such simple docking studies are valuable for high throughput screening they might be more suited to small molecules where the molecule is less likely to have a major effect on RNA conformation.

The bases of the tetraloop comprise the relatively stable wobble base pair of U13 and G18, but also G17 which shows transient trans bonding with C14 either as trans Sugar/WC or trans WC. This has also been identified by NMR. In this loop region the stacking between A15 and C14 is largely preserved as is the overall stacking between the U residues and the G; these are likewise as described in NMR.

An aspect not observed in the NMR analysis is a transient non-traditional pairing of A12-A20, which leaves U11 as temporary bulge. This changes the overall structure of that region to a ladder-like (less helical) stacking and changes the overall distance between the loop and the base of the stem.

TiCA using lag time of 200steps (2ns), as expected proved more revealing and describes a more diverse landscape with at least 4 distinct points in the first two projections and many more in projections including the 3 rd and 4 th components.

Strong stacking of the A2-U20 to C4-G19 and C5,U18 to U6:A17 is also stable throughout the simulation and consistent with the NMR data. The C4 G19 residues do not have typical A-RNA torsion angles because the stacking with the adjacent (problematic) pair is less extensive. G19 can transiently base pair with A3 and stack with C5 and in a similar way U18 can base pair to U6. Finally, in the loop region A13 is transiently both trans or cis Sugar/WC paired with G10.

MSM calculates every pairwise transition at a given lag-time for the MSM (which independent of the TICA lag time). It is essential that the selected lag time is long enough to ensure Markovian dynamics (ie. to have a stable transition matrix), but short enough to resolve the transition dynamics.

If the resulted model includes all states, the original space can then be split into the longest living meta-stable states with care taken to ensure sure that those states are well defined on the discretised surface( Figure S14 ).For each state a sample of 10 pdb structures is extracted and represented in Leontis-Westholf notation using barnaba ( Figure S14 ). Finally spectral clustering using PCCA++ algorithm coarse-grains the space of the metastable distributions and approximates the stationary probabilities and relative free energies for that particular set of data (Table 1) and not for the overall system.
