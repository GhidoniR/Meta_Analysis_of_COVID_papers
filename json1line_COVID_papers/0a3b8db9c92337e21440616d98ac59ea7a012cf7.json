Moreover, children with DS with sepsis have a higher risk of death than controls with sepsis, therefore this predisposition to COVID-19-induced sepsis is important to monitor. 10, 11 In addition, hospitalized patients with DS (41.7%) were significantly more likely to require mechanical ventilation than controls (13.3%) (p<0.05), which is another marker of severe disease in DS.

Only recently, a few studies have experimentally addressed the perturbed immune state that had been observed in DS. 12, 13 Herein, we report an analysis of individuals with DS who were hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Mount Sinai and Columbia University health systems. Twelve patients with DS admitted with COVID-19 likely suggests a somewhat increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalization in this population. It is unknown whether biological or environmental factors, or some combination thereof contribute to this increased risk. People with DS living in group homes, which was the case for half of the patients in our cohort, may have increased risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. It is also prudent to assume a certain level of underestimation of COVID-19 susceptibility in DS due to social behavior. Namely, given lifelong, repeated medical interventions and clinical monitoring, individuals with DS, whether deciding alone or under advice of their caregivers, are likely practicing social isolation more rigorously than the general population. True exposure will only be ascertained once we are able to evaluate and compare seroprevalence in DS to that of the general population in the same geographic location.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 91, "end": 92, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 371, "end": 374, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 375, "end": 377, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Be that as it may, the twelve hospitalized patients with DS were on average over ten years younger than hospitalized patients with COVID-19 without DS. Despite the relatively young age of the DS cohort however, eight out of twelve of them were above the 86th percentile for age of the DS population (i.e. 50 years old), suggesting that older age is an important factor for COVID-19 susceptibility in DS. Moreover, people with DS have a mean life expectancy of approximately 53 years, therefore the lack of older patients in our cohort may in part be a reflection of the scarcity of older individuals with DS. 1 However, even when only considering patients under the estimated life expectancy of people with DS, individuals with DS were significantly younger than those without DS in the same age range. Interestingly, in large survey of individuals with DS who were positive for COVID-19 or had symptoms associated with the disease (n= 349), researchers found an increase in fatal outcomes starting at age 40, about 10 years earlier than the general population. 14 Of documented comorbidities associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and dementia may predispose patients with DS to severe COVID-19. Importantly, we did not find any diagnoses of lower airway anomalies in our patient cohort, although these have been proposed as a cause of increased respiratory infections in patients with DS. 15 Indeed, there are reported cases of patients with DS, airway obstruction, pulmonary hypertension, and congenital heart disease who were hospitalized with COVID-19. 16 Furthermore, we must also consider the unevaluated parameters which may be contributing to the disease in DS. For example, B cell numbers and quality, T cell function, secreted inflammatory mediators, and response to type I IFNs might all be factors causing an altered response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in DS. In addition, TMPRSS2, which encodes a serine protease that facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry 17 , is located on chromosome 21 and is therefore triplicated in DS. It will be important to characterize whether TMPRSS2 expression is increased in the lungs of patients with DS, and if this alters these individuals' susceptibility to COVID-19.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 609, "end": 610, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1421, "end": 1423, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1588, "end": 1590, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Finally, we found more severe disease progression in patients with DS compared to controls.

We also found that patients with DS were more likely to die in the hospital than controls. A report of increased susceptibility to severe COVID-19 in individuals with DS in a healthcare facility for intellectual disability is another example of why extra caution should be taken for these patients, especially in group homes. 19 In line with the fact that respiratory infections are a leading cause of death in DS, accounting for 34-40% of mortality, the increased severity of COVID-19 in DS is of importance. 4 In conclusion, our study highlights that particular attention should be paid to both the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in individuals with DS, as they are at higher risk of hospitalization-induced complications during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 268, "end": 270, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 457, "end": 459, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 904, "end": 906, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1088, "end": 1089, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The study was approved under the protocols Mount Sinai Health System IRB-18-00638 and Columbia University Irving Medical Center IRB-AAAS9860.
