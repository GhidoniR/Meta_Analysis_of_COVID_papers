Some factors are difficult to quantify objectively in decision-making, but evidence-based scientific factors, such as incubation period, latent period, and intergenerational interval, can quantitatively assess the potential development trajectory of the epidemic under different policies, which can be used to assist decision-making. In recent years, the proportion of technical means such as infectious disease modeling and data visualization based on big data has been increasing in public health decision-making. For example, we can quickly collect available information, evaluate the characteristics of new pathogens, the severity of the disease, the number of possible susceptible persons and the possible causes of the outbreak, and determine the possible development degree and scope of public health emergencies, so as to make decisions for the selection and implementation of intervention measures for public health emergencies [1] . However, for an emerging infectious disease, such as 1918 influenza, SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, it is difficult for epidemiologists or modelers to predict the spread extent and transmission ability of the disease in a short time. Therefore, the other side of the actual situation is that sometimes, in the absence of clear epidemiological evidence, even with the limited human-to-human transmission, decision-makers have to respond to public health emergencies and propose or take certain public health measures, such as the scope of epidemiological investigation, the screening, tracking and management of key populations, and the determination of risk areas. In such situations, public health decision-making may have considerable uncertainty.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1095, "end": 1098, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction\uff1a"}, {"text": "In the 1920s, Kermack and McKendrick proposed the SIR infectious disease transmission dynamics model. Until now, the SIR model has been widely used and developing [2] . The transmission dynamics model is an important method for theoretical and quantitative research on the transmission of infectious diseases. A mathematical model reflecting the dynamic characteristics of infectious diseases was established according to the characteristics of different host populations, the occurrence of diseases, the transmission, and development of diseases in different populations, as well as the related social factors. The epidemic rule and trend can be explored, the causes and key factors can be analyzed, and the optimal strategy of prevention and control can be determined through the qualitative and quantitative analysis and numerical simulation of the model dynamics. By simulating the transmission process of infectious diseases in the hosts, the transmission dynamics model integrates the previous empirical evidence systematically and transparently; however, it is difficult for non-professionals to understand the results of the transmission dynamics model. and evaluation of prevention and control strategies [3] . It is essential to use mathematical modeling to complete the above research contents. Timothy W Russel published a study online in March 2020 to explore how to use the adjusted crude case fatality rate to correct the deficiency of case reports, and then to indicate the potential scale of epidemic transmission. A series of updates were carried out to maintain the accuracy and rationality of modeling between crude case fatality rate and epidemic scale and severit [18] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 163, "end": 166, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1214, "end": 1217, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1686, "end": 1690, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction\uff1a"}, {"text": "Hauster et al. also conducted a similar study and proposed that sCFR and IFR could be used to improve and monitor clinical strategies and public health strategies [19] . and if the control measures were extended to April, the second peak could be extended to October, and the possible peak could be flattened by gradually relaxing the intervention [20] . However, in the contact network model, it is very important to distinguish between repeated contact and new contact for disease transmission, and more complex models are needed to explain the contact parameters within family members. The construction of an infectious disease dynamics model can predict the epidemic trend, but at the same time, the transmission of the epidemic is a complex process. Research on this complex biological process needs to continuously incorporate the knowledge of emerging disciplines, explore the special internal laws and description methods of the current social epidemic system and promote the substantial progress of applied science. As time goes on, with the continuous acquisition of field data, the measures will change and the mathematical models will change as well, and so will the decision-making ( Figure 5 ).

In other words, the COVID-19 pandemic has objectively strengthened the relationship between infectious disease modeling and public health decision-making and led decision-makers and more researchers to see the practical significance of infectious disease modeling. Especially for decision-makers, this process cultivates their scientific spirit, which provides a broader space for the development of infectious disease modeling.

However, the framework ignored the importance of time and space. Taking the response to the COVID-19 as an example, field data was gradually accumulated during the development of the epidemic, and at the same time the parameters and requirements of mathematical modeling were improved.

Since the birth of the dynamic model in the 1970s, its application in the field of infectious disease research has been increasing year by year, but there was a slight decline in 2020.

In May 2003, Lipstich et al.[5] and Riley et al.[6] conducted the first quantitative analysis on the transmission dynamics of SARS and the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions. They pointed out that the basic reproduction number R 0 of SARS was between 2 to 4, and that the transmission of the epidemic was successfully controlled through non-pharmaceutical interventions such as controlling hospital infection and reducing population mobility. In April 2004, Masuda et al. proposed a dynamic Small-World model of SARS transmission, which considered that the biological characteristics and social group attributes of individuals were more important factors affecting communication than the heterogeneity of social contact among individuals, and explained the phenomenon of super-spreaders[7]. In May 2005, two years after the outbreak of SARS, Massad et al. published a transmission dynamics model to analyze the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the transmission of SARS, which discussed the role of modeling in public health and evaluated the feasibility of modeling as an evaluation tool for non-pharmaceuticalinterventions[8].", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF5": {"text": "on transmission dynamics model and public health policy of MERS It is difficult to estimate the role and impact of the transmission dynamics model in the prediction and control of the MERS epidemic. Nevertheless, the studies on transmission characteristics and transmission dynamics modeling of MERS were published one year after the indication case report. On the one hand, due to the limited interpersonal communication ability of MERS, it took a long time for scholars to collect the data required for modeling; on the other hand, it is also because of the limited interpersonal communication ability that appropriate non-pharmaceutical interventions can easily reduce the transmission index, and the demand of public health decision-making for the prediction of infectious diseases is not strong. In January 2014, Majumder et al. described the characteristics of the transmission dynamics of MERS, quantified the uncertainty of the continuous transmission of MERS in humans by constructing a dynamic model and estimated the possible epidemic scale and the limited bias of case detection according to the case fatality rate, suggesting the risk of interpersonal transmission of MERS[9]. In December 2014, Chowell et al. analyzed the transmission capacity of MERS under different scenarios, predicted the transmission risk, and provided decision assistance for disease surveillance and the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions[10]. In November 2013, Cauchemez S et al. estimated the basic reproduction number R 0 and case fatality rate CFR of MERS based on public data, and believed that the global should continue paying attention to the spread and control of MERS[11].", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "hard to quantify the support of the research on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 to public health policy, but the related research covers all aspects of public health policy in various countries around the world.

The results showed that all these four non-pharmacological measures could reduce R 0 , but the combination was more effective[21]. Joel et al. explained the feasibility of epidemic control through close tracking management from the perspective of the transmission dynamics model. They believed that the epidemic could be controlled if the transmission was terminated within 12 weeks after the report of the index case or before the overall scale of the epidemic was less than 5000 cases. The increase in the number of initial cases and the emergence of asymptomatic transmission would reduce the prevention and control effect of isolation management and close tracking[22].
