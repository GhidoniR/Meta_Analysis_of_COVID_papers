Research has found, for example, that Whites' racial bias is linked to Black-White income inequality [42] . Biased decision making could also contribute to racial inequities in COVID-19 outcomes through differences in access to protective resources such as private versus public transportation options, physical distancing versus crowding within various spaces (e.g., homes, neighborhoods, workplaces), access to quality healthcare, and other structural factors. In addition, Black people are over-represented among lower wage workers deemed as \"essential\" in the workforce (e.g., caregivers, bus drivers, cashiers), and thereby maintain higher risk of COVID-19 exposure compared to White people who are more likely to be able to work from home [43, 44] . Further, ongoing inequities such as residential segregation and differential access to quality housing, healthcare, higher education, and higher wages have long contributed to Black-White inequities in a range of illnesses including cardiovascular disease and risk of mortality [29, 30, 45] , all of which are associated with increased risk of COVID-19 infection and worse disease severity [46] .

A recent study showed that counties with higher social capital operating as civic norms that foster cooperation, collective action, and community trust had increased social distancing [48] . Community-level social capital has also been shown to mediate associations between community-level racial prejudice and mortality among Black and White residents [28] , which may help explain, in part, our finding of higher incidence among Whites. Indicators of social capital include interpersonal trust, civic and political engagement, and access to services and resources [47] . For example, socially cohesive communities are more successful at collective lobbying to preserve local services and amenities [49, 50] , benefiting members of advantaged and disadvantaged racial groups. It is conceivable that residents living in counties with higher anti-Black bias are less trusting of community members, leading to the erosion of social capital, which is harmful for both Black and White residents. Support for shared resources and programs that benefit the population as a whole may be especially important in a pandemic for the poor, homeless, institutionalized elderly, and other low-status groups in biased areas, regardless of race. Lower social capital could also disrupt trust and reciprocity between community members, possibly reducing the motivation to practice collective action to protect each other from COVID-19 by wearing a mask, physical distancing, or sharing resources and information. Social capital may be improved by public policies aimed to reduce racial residential, educational, and occupational segregation, thereby fostering meaningful intergroup contact, which has been shown to reduce prejudice and improve in-group connections, cross-group empathy, and community trust [51] [52] [53] .

Counties where NH White individuals harbor greater levels of anti-Black racial bias may be characterized by greater racial tension and hostility, leading to stressful interracial interactions which can trigger biopsychosocial stress-response processes [54, 55] . These processes, in turn, may decrease immunity [56] , increase generalized susceptibility [57] to infectious agents [6] , and lead to physical and mental exhaustion which impairs adherence to health-preserving behavioral changes, such as mask-wearing. While community tension and hostility may create stress for everyone, the effects may be disproportionately harmful for Black residents. For example, some have suggested that Black individuals living in areas with higher levels of racial bias may encounter more interpersonal and institutional racial discrimination [23, 25] , a toxic psychosocial stressor associated with myriad adverse health outcomes [20] . They may also be more likely to experience uniquely stressful life events (such as racism-related job losses or police encounters) [54] . Moreover, living in counties with higher levels of anti-Black bias may cause stress from collective or vicarious racism experiences, even in the absence of direct interpersonal racism encounters [54] . Finally, chronic contextual stress (stress resulting from the socio-political climate and inequitable social structure) [54] may be more salient in counties with more racial bias. Indeed, previous work has linked community-level racial bias with stress-related outcomes among racially minoritized groups, including cardiovascular risk factors and adverse birth outcomes [25, 27, 29] .

Further, race-disaggregated data excludes the surge of COVID-19 cases in the Sun Belt during the summer and in the Midwest during the fall; hence, counties in the Northeast are likely overrepresented. Future research with more national data and a longer time frame will bolster our understanding of these associations and whether they change over the course of the pandemic.

However, this indicator is imperfect and there likely remains confounding via unmeasured socio-political pathways through which NH whites' county-level racial bias may influence COVID-19 outcomes. In addition, variation in R 2 values suggests that some variables in our collective set of covariates predict more of the variance than others.

This has critical implications for future research and present policy. Future studies should examine mediators and modifiers of the association between anti-Black bias and COVID-19 outcomes, especially mechanisms amenable to short-term policy responses. Public policies promoting meaningful community-level intergroup contact may help mitigate the effects of racial bias through increased cross-group trust and empathy, and social capital. Given the incomplete nature of available data on this critical issue, researchers and policymakers should prioritize the development of a national registry of COVID-19 patients including demographic characteristics.
