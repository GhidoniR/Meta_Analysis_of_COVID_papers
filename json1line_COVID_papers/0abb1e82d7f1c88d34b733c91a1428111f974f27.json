Neurologically impaired children are a vulnerable population with specific needs in terms of protection against infection and access to health services. Objectives: We investigated the effects of lockdown on the health of children with neurological disorders and on their access to care during lockdown. Methods: Data from 514 children (282 males e 232 females) were collected through physicianadministered interviews to investigate: the occurrence of viral-like physical symptoms, the correlation between the risk of developing such symptoms and several demographic and clinical variables, the occurrence of any worsening of the children's neurological conditions during lockdown, and their access to care services during this period. Results: 49.1% experienced at least one symptom during the study period, but no child developed severe complications. The prevalence of symptoms was significantly lower during lockdown than during the previous two months. The underlying neurological condition worsened in 11.5% of the patients. Children who regularly left the home during lockdown were greater risk of exhibiting symptoms. During lockdown, 67.7% had a specialist appointment cancelled, 52.6% contacted their paediatrician, and 30.9% contacted their child neuropsychiatrist. Among patients who usually receive rehabilitation, 49.5% continued remotely. Conclusion: Lockdown protected children from infections. Telemedicine and telerehabilitation constituted a valid alternative for the care and treatment of these children, but they should not become a widespread and definitive model of care. COVID-19 and other emergency response plans must take into account the specific needs of children with disabilities.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Worldwide, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments to introduce drastic containment and social distancing measures. In Italy, the first European country hit by the emergency, the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported on February 21, 2020. To limit the spread of infection, the Italian government responded to the outbreak with a series of increasingly far-reaching measures. Schools were closed in six northern regions on February 23, 2020 and nationwide on March 4, 2020. A week later, on 11 March, all non-essential activities were suspended and citizens were instructed not to leave their homes except for essential reasons and emergencies. This full lockdown lasted until May 4, 2020. 1 The effects of these measures in cost-benefit terms are now the subject of heated debate. 2e4 The scope of this debate, which affects everyone, is now broadening as more and more aspects are analysed. As child neuropsychiatrists we are particularly interested in establishing the pros and cons of lockdown for children with neurological disorders. Children with disabilities are a particularly fragile population whose complex needs must be borne in mind when defining health policies that affect them, particularly in serious emergency situations like the current one. 5, 6 The most recent data support the widespread fear that people with disabilities are more at risk of developing complications of COVID-19 (especially at younger ages). 7e9 Such findings can hardly be considered surprising, given that people with disabilities are more likely than those without disabilities to have underlying health problems 10, 11 and to live in community care settings, 12 two factors that increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 5,13e15 Furthermore, because of the nature of some disabilities, affected individuals may have difficulty implementing routine prevention measures. Although data in children are still scarce, it has been shown that those with underlying neurological conditions are more likely to die from seasonal influenza. 5, 16 Taken together, all this evidence suggests that very strict isolation and prevention measures are appropriate in children with chronic neurological diseases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 437, "end": 454, "text": "February 23, 2020", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 704, "end": 705, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 796, "end": 799, "text": "2e4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1276, "end": 1278, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1279, "end": 1280, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1621, "end": 1624, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1625, "end": 1627, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1668, "end": 1670, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1731, "end": 1738, "text": "5,13e15", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2040, "end": 2042, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2043, "end": 2045, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Against this, however, it must be appreciated that such measures limit access to primary care and rehabilitation services, 17 and that restricting an individual's usual activities is likely to induce mental stress. 18 This applies to healthy people as well as those with disabilities. It is a particular problem in children and adolescents, in whom social deprivation, isolation and school closures caused by lockdown rules have been shown to create difficulties and reduce quality of life. 8,19e21 Overall, these considerations suggest that children with neurological disorders may face a worsening of their condition as an effect both of the new pattern of everyday life imposed by the state of lockdown, and of the difficulty accessing the care they need. 22 With the aim of at least partially unravelling this complex scenario, we retrospectively analysed the impact, in a sample of children with neurological disorders and complex disabilities, of the lockdown measures imposed during the COVID-19 emergency in Lombardy. Lombardy was the first Italian region to be affected by the new coronavirus and has been by far the hardest hit.
