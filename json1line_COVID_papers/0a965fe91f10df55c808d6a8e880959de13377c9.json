Sixteen of our patients had undergone testing for SARS-CoV-2 by 7 July 2020, and five patients (5/243; 2%) tested positive. Table 1 shows selected features of these infected patients. The total number of documented COVID-19 infections in Turkey at that time was approximately 207,000 (0.25% of Turkey's population). All five patients received a diagnosis of CML in the chronic phase and currently have optimal responses under tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment. Three patients were continuing imatinib treatment since their diagnosis. Two patients were receiving nilotinib, one due to imatinib failure and the other due to imatinib intolerance. The only notable TKI toxicity with the current treatments was QTc prolongation observed in Patient #4 in 2013 under nilotinib, which required a dose reduction. All patients underwent thorax computed tomography (CT), which showed features of pneumonia in three cases. All five patients recovered without the need for oxygen support, and TKI treatment was interrupted in the two patients who used nilotinib due to concerns of drug-drug interactions and QTc prolongation. The other three patients were receiving imatinib, which was continued during the infection in two patients and withheld in one. Four patients received prophylactic enoxaparin (Patients #1, #3, #4, and #5), and three received hydroxychloroquine and macrolide combinations (Patients #1, #2, and #4).

These values are difficult to compare as the numbers are low and the methods and the timings are different. TKIs are proposed to be protective against COVID-19 [3] ; however, some consequences of continuing TKIs during COVID-19 also raise concerns. When our data are included, seven patients (five imatinib [2] , one dasatinib [6] , one flumatinib [2] ) continued TKI treatment during COVID-19 with one fatality. Four patients who discontinued TKIs recovered uneventfully [2] . Another recent paper from the Netherlands found no alarming events in a CML cohort of 148 patients regarding the COVID-19 pandemic [7] .
