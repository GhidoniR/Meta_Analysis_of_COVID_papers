Design Rapid scoping review of peer-reviewed literature from 1 January to 5 December 2020 using the LitCovid database and the Cochrane library. Setting International studies on the infectiousness of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. Participants Studies were selected for inclusion if they defined asymptomatics as a separate cohort distinct from presymptomatics and if they provided a quantitative measure of the infectiousness of asymptomatics relative to symptomatics. Primary outcome measures PCR result (PCR studies), the rate of infection (mathematical modelling studies) and secondary attack rate (contact tracing studies) -in each case from asymptomatic in comparison with symptomatic individuals. Results There are only a limited number of published studies that report estimates of relative infectiousness of asymptomatic compared with symptomatic individuals. 12 studies were included after the screening process. Significant differences exist in the definition of infectiousness. PCR studies in general show no difference in shedding levels between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals; however, the number of study subjects is generally limited. Two modelling studies estimate relative infectiousness to be 0.43 and 0.57, but both of these were more reflective of the infectiousness of undocumented rather than asymptomatic cases. The results from contact tracing studies include estimates of relative infectiousness of 0, but with insufficient evidence to conclude that it is significantly different from 1. Conclusions There is considerable heterogeneity in estimates of relative infectiousness highlighting the need for further investigation of this important parameter.

The adjusted ORs for transmission risk based on the severity of the primary cases from asymptomatic, mild, moderate and severe are reported in the Luo et al 17 study.

The quality of the five PCR study papers varied, based on the criteria used. The quality of Lavezzo et al 1 and Danis et al 12 was assessed to be high quality, although the number of cases in Danis et al 12 was very small (five symptomatic, one asymptomatic). Several of the studies will need to be generalised with care, either because they represent a limited age cohort (Letizia et al 13 ; young Marine Corp recruits) or only a subset of the spectrum of symptoms that could present (Long et al 9 ; Uhm et al 11 ; mild symptoms only, among symptomatics). The quality of the two modelling studies was considered to be low with respect to our parameter of interest. The primary reason for this was that these models were generally developed for a purpose other than estimating relative infectiousness. Therefore, the compartments used sometimes indirectly represented asymptomatics (eg, by assuming that asymptomatic cases were always undocumented). Furthermore, since relative infectiousness was not the primary parameter of interest, the value was often estimated within a relatively small range of possible values. The five contact tracing studies were assessed to be of generally good quality against the five quality criteria that were used, based on the reported information. However, some indication of a longitudinal study component was reported in Luo et al 17 and Pluckinski et al 3 ; however, it is unclear whether preasymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals were successfully separated.

Even if asymptomatic individuals are a smaller proportion of the overall cohort of infected individuals, their potential to transmit could be significant since they are unlikely to undertake the same controls (eg, self-isolation) to limit the spread of infection to others as they are unlikely to be aware that they are infected. It is also an important parameter that is used as a prior value in mathematical models that measure the dynamics of COVID-19. Relative infectiousness can be estimated using three methods as outlined previously, namely PCR studies, mathematical modelling and contact tracing.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "A number of studies have used PCR results to estimate viral load, which offers one means to estimate the relative infectiousness of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. In four of the five PCR studies reviewed here (Uhm et al, 11 Lavezzo et al, 1 Danis et al 12 and Long et al 9 ) , no substantial difference between asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals was observed, mainly relating to Ct values at an initial test. In contrast, Letizia et al 13 report viral load at diagnosis approximately four times higher in symptomatic compared with asymptomatic individuals. Furthermore, Long et al 9 found that the duration of shedding among asymptomatic was longer than for mild symptomatic individuals. We note, however, that these conclusions need to be interpreted with care because PCR is a proxy for viral load; it measures genetic material and does not distinguish infectious and non-infectious virus. As noted by Atkinson and Petersen, 18 measurable virus shedding does not equate with viral infectivity, and further evaluation is needed to determine the respiratory SARS-CoV-2 viral load that is correlated with culturable virus. 18 Nonetheless, this method could still be valid in a comparative sense, as long as testing was conducted at equivalent time points during the infectious profile of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. It is unclear whether this was achieved in the reviewed studies, based on testing frequencies described as either on consecutive days for a period (Danis et al 12 Most of the studies are based on a small number of cases, which may limit the ability to detect differences if present. A further challenge with these studies, and indeed with all studies in this scoping review, relates to the concern that presymptomatics (ie, those individuals that do not yet have clinical signs but will go on to develop symptoms) could be included in the definition of asymptomatics. This will occur in the absence of sufficient follow-up. In each of the reviewed studies, we sought evidence of Open access follow-up at the very least and ideally the gold standard methodology proposed by Buitrago-Garcia et al. 8 With the five PCR studies, it was generally the former rather than the latter that is described. Finally, the external validity of the PCR studies was variable. For three of the studies, generalisability was limited due to the individuals under investigation: Uhm et al 11 Estimates from modelling studies provide the second method of estimating relative infectiousness for this virus. Li et al 10 reported the infectiousness of 'undocumented' rather than asymptomatic individuals. Three separate estimates of the infectiousness of undocumented infections were reported for the Li et al study. The proportion of undocumented cases (compared with documented) consecutively decreased with time points corresponding to greater restrictions. The authors argue that this was likely to have occurred since, with greater restrictions, it was more likely that symptomatic individuals would be tested and therefore become documented. Furthermore, individuals were more likely to be tested as time progressed given the growing awareness of COVID-19. Consequently, we recommend that the most recent value, 0.43 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.61), should be used for the measure of relative infectiousness from this study. 10 Relative infectiousness is estimated to be 0.57 (the average of five values (see table 1)) in the Nabi study. 2 CM carried out a quality appraisal of the two studies. The authors subsequently agreed that the Li et al 10 study appeared to have a high level of quality in terms of its consideration of the range of values within which the model estimate was confined and its model validation; it used synthetic data initially, and the model was applied separately to different time points in the outbreak. However, both studies do not appear to have properly represented the asymptomatic cohort appropriately; in both Nabi and Li et al 10 , asymptomatics are referred to 'undocumented' rather than 'asymptomatic' per se. 2 Estimates from these studies must therefore be treated with significant caution.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 232, "end": 234, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 250, "end": 251, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 264, "end": 266, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 282, "end": 285, "text": "9 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1139, "end": 1141, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1506, "end": 1508, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2142, "end": 2143, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2414, "end": 2416, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3342, "end": 3344, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 4064, "end": 4065, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Contract tracing studies have formed the basis for a third method to estimate relative infectiousness.
