This finding contrasts with recently published research, which found significantly lower IgG levels in 37 asymptomatic patients compared to 37 age-and sexmatched symptomatic patients during both the acute and early convalescent phases [19] . There are several possible explanations for this difference. First, because asymptomatic cases in that study were detected through testing of contacts of known cases, the interval from exposure to testing may have been shorter than for matched symptomatic cases, meaning asymptomatic cases would have had less time for a measurable IgG response to develop [19] . This is supported by the authors' finding that time from first to last positive PCR result was longer in the asymptomatic group. In our study, date of exposure should have been on average the same for symptomatic and asymptomatic participants. Second, asymptomatic patients in the abovementioned study were treated with \u03b1-interferon, ribavirin and additional supportive treatments according to local protocol [19] , possibly clouding the natural history of disease. This particular group of returned travellers presented a problem for public health authorities. Cruise ship outbreaks were particularly prominent in the media at the time after more than a hundred cases were identified linked to passengers allowed to disembark from Ruby Princess [30] . Participants in our study were not provided formal laboratory results confirming infection but few remained positive in Melbourne. IgG testing confirmed the overseas test reports for 35 participants and suggested a further nine had been infected despite the absence of a positive PCR report. In this cohort, there appears to have been utility in using serology to confirm infection, where the prevalence of disease was high and sufficient time had passed to permit development of detectable antibodies. However, its utility in other cohorts may be limited if the prevalence of infection is lower (therefore negatively influencing the positive predictive value), or during acute infection before antibody is detectable.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 386, "end": 390, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 749, "end": 753, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1165, "end": 1169, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1502, "end": 1506, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "This study had several limitations. First, the relatively low participation rate raises the possibility that participation bias affected the study results. Specifically, individuals who had already tested positive, or those who had experienced symptoms but not received a positive result, may have been disproportionately motivated to participate in order to have confirmation of infection through antibody testing, leading to overestimation of the attack rate and underestimation of the asymptomatic fraction. Indeed, PCR positivity on 3 April was slightly higher in the study population than among all people on the ship (73% vs. 59%), based on another report on this outbreak [23] . According to the same report, only 19% of PCR-positive individuals on board were symptomatic. However, it is unclear whether this number reflects the proportion that was symptomatic only at the time of testing, and if not, for how long cases were followed to determine if they went on to develop symptoms [23] . Furthermore, because symptom data in the present study were recorded about 3 weeks after onset, poor recall may have contributed to overestimation of the asymptomatic fraction, countering some of the effect of the hypothesised participation bias. In addition, some symptoms, including headache or loss of taste or smell were not explicitly queried in our study. Second, the identification of risk factors for symptomatic disease was limited by the small sample size. For example, to detect statistically significant differences, the true relative risk for the effect of sex would need to be at least 3.11 or no more than 0.32, and for the presence of comorbidities at least 2.71 or no more than 0.37. Finally, the study population was mostly aged over 50 years, so caution should be exercised in generalising the findings to the broader population.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 679, "end": 683, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 991, "end": 995, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "To conclude, in this cohort, asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 was common and the humoral immune response was not dependent on the presence of symptoms. By 3 weeks after disease onset, viral load in respiratory and GI samples was low or undetectable, but serology was useful for confirming prior infection. Demographics and presence of comorbidities were not strong predictors of symptomatic vs. asymptomatic disease within this study population. Study of other potential predictors of symptomatic illness, for example genetic or immunologic factors, could inform screening strategies or therapeutics. Research involving longitudinal follow-up of seropositive individuals will help to predict duration of immunity and the utility of sero-surveys in estimating population exposure.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Supplementary material.
