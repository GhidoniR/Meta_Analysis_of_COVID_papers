The present study aimed to explore the perception and understanding of the students and teachers regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the academic life and career pursuit of university students in Bangladesh. With a semistructured interview schedule, data for this qualitative study were collected from 8 purposively selected participants, using telephone interviews, affiliated with a public university in Bangladesh. Students argued that the extended closure is responsible for the delayed graduation of the senior students, thereby, mounting mental stress and frustration among them. The informants unequivocally opposed the online education platform, as a solution for the ongoing gap, due to scarcity of the resources, and unequal accesses and opportunities for all. It has been suggested that the education gap can be reduced by shortening the term, curtailing the preparatory leave, and taking extra classes over the weekends when the universities re-open together with enforced collective health hygiene.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Originated from Wuhan, China, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) (Harper et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) , spread around the globe since December 2019, and forced the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020b . Unlike, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic in 2002 and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak in 2012 (Lee et al., 2019) , the overall case fatality rate of COVID-19 is still much lower (approximately 2.67 percent among the total confirmed cases) (Deng and Peng, 2020) . Nevertheless, in the absence of precise antidotes or vaccines and the erratic nature of COVID-19, for instance, speedy transmission, high infection ratio, and death toll, make it a global challenge to confront (Ahorsu et al., 2020; Dar et al., 2017; Deng and Peng, 2020) . As the disease is highly contagious, the WHO recommends maintaining the social distancing (e.g., at least 1 m between and among people, avoid crowd and public gathering) to curb the disease (World Health Organization, 2020a) . Worldwide, countries have adopted different non-therapeutic measures and strategies, including shutting down the educational and administrative institutions, closing the market and other public spaces along with the transport system to restrict free movement and public gathering (Ahmed et al., 2020a; Anwar et al., 2020; Chen and Yuan, 2020; Satici et al., 2020) . Educational institutions across the globe postponed on-campus activities to protect students and academic staffs from the risk of being infected with COVID-19 (Sahu, 2020; United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization, 2020a , 2020c . However, the prolonged closing has a significant impact not only on the academic life of about 1.3 billion learners from schools, colleges, and universities in 185 countries (United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization, 2020a , 2020c , but also on their mental well-being.

Besides, there are different courses like laboratory classes and works, filed works, music and art courses which are not possible to continue through online classes (Sahu, 2020) . In a similar vein, our findings suggest that in Bangladesh, both students and teachers are reluctant regarding online education mainly because of the scarcity and inequitable distribution of the required resources.
