Based on the predicted structure of TRAP, the changes in free energy difference before and after the mutations (\u0394\u0394G) were calculated, and the result shows that these mutations L49V, R285G, R285S, P299S and K421N would lead to the destabilization because of the obviously increased free energy difference (\u0394\u0394G > 1). Furthermore, the spatial conformational changes of the twelve relatively common (> 10% globally) mutations at T cell epitopes were predicted and presented in Fig. 5 . According to it, 7 amino acid substitutions (E46Q, I116S, K119R, S123N, Y128F, L287P and R290W) were identified as would lead to the breakage of hydrogen bonding, which would further impair the stability of the protein structure after these mutations (Fig. 5 ).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 162, "end": 170, "text": "(Fig. 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 646, "end": 652, "text": "Fig. 5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 906, "end": 913, "text": "(Fig. 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "3D7"}, {"text": "As PfTRAP was the potential candidate for anti-malarial vaccine and there are several PfTRAP-based vaccines undergoing the clinical trials [25] [26] [27] , the worldwide information of its polymorphism was necessary and important for design and improvement of an effective vaccine.

This phenomenon is in line with the polymorphism result, which shows more mutations appear in African area and thereby lead to the abundant haplotypes. Moreover, the vast majority of these haplotypes are presented as singletons and the high prevalence of singleton is probably associated with the intensity of transmission or rapid expansion of population. Even so, the genetic differentiation between African countries shows limited and so do Asian countries, but an obvious genetic differentiation is found between countries which come (See figure on next page.) Fig. 3 CD8+ T cell and linear B cell Epitopes and amino acids substitution distribution of PfTRAP gene. The full-length TRAP sequences (1-559aa) was referred to the 3D7 isolates (NCBI Gene ID: 814170).

Sequences in gray block is the repeat region. Amino acid in red is for mutant Lin et al. Malar J (2021) 20:124 from different continents. It might be explained with the population segregation of Anopheles, the host of P. falciparum, caused by the geographical separation. But interestingly, though Bioko Island is an island separated from African mainland by the Atlantic Ocean, its PfTRAP gene shows low genetic differentiation with other African mainland countries. This result might be explained by the work of Guerra et al. [31, 32] , which reported that the strong connection of human movement between Bioko and the mainland Equatorial Guinea (EG), determine a high vulnerability of Bioko to malaria importation; these studies reported that the odds of malaria infection in travellers who had been to mainland EG were more than three times the rest of the population, which confirmed that the majority malaria cases are actively imported by off-island travelers to mainland EG [31, 32] . In general, the non-negligible geographical characteristic might provide a new insight for the development of universal PfTRAP-based vaccine. Antigen polymorphism has been a major obstacle in the way of developing effective vaccines. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of protective roles of CD8+ T-cell and memory T-cell responses to PfTRAP from clinical malaria cases [33, 34] . Mutations on the surface of the antigen make it more difficult for the host immune system to recognize the antigen, and even lead to immune avoidance and reduce the immune effect. The present study had found a large number of substitutions located at the antigen epitopes, and the destructive prediction was presented.

Polyphen score without * indicated benign mutation in this study reflect the potential destructive effect on the protein structure and further impaction of TRAP function. As it is known that TRAP is a protein that plays an important role in the sporozoite gliding motility, hepatocyte invasion and establishment of infection in the vertebrate host [6] [7] [8] , thus 'damaging mutations' might affect these functions but it would not be a threat to survival, which could explain that why the parasites with 'damaging mutations' still alive and be detected. Furthermore, TRAP as a vaccine candidate gene of great potential, the 'damaging mutations' probably affect the effectiveness of the vaccine, for the protein surface structure were changed. Several mutations were predicted as damaging (I116T, L122I, Y128F, G228V and P299S), and Y128F is noteworthy with global frequency of 21%. Some 'possibly damaging' mutations such as E46Q, I116S and T134S were also found in high frequency globally (24%, 13% and 37%, respectively). As these mutations were in such high frequency and were predicted as damaging to TRAP function or structure, the follow-up continuous monitoring project is worth to pay special attention to. Nowadays, several malaria vaccines encoding the preerythrocytic antigen ME-TRAP, which often coupled with different adjuvants such as Chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd63) or modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA), had been developed and issued by researchers have entered the clinical trial stage [26, 27] . Still, these effects are not ideal for the goal of developing a globally effective vaccine. Some researchers had put forward a new insight that CSP-TRAP fusion antigens (TRAP N-terminal domains fused to circumsporozoite protein C-terminus with or without repeat region) could produce an effective host immune and it has been validated in vitro cell experiments [35] . In this global analysis, the TRAP N-terminal domains (including Signal Sequences, A-domain and TSR) showed active genetic mutation, especially in A-domain, and there were 8 mutations predicted to do harm to protein structure or function. It presents the suggestion that the application of TRAP N-terminal domains in the vaccine components might deserve more observation and in-depth assessment. Moreover, as the previous research shown, there are numerous epitopes were predicted in the conserved regions that signifies the possibility of the development of a universal TRAP-based malaria vaccine design [36] .
