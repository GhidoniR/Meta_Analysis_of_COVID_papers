The reliability of biochemical data derived from these measurements is dependent on the quality of the sample collection and exact preparation and analysis protocols. Here, we describe systematically, the impact of variations in sample collection and preparation on information recovery from quantitative proton ( 1 H) NMR spectroscopy of human blood plasma and serum. The effects of variation of blood collection tube sizes and preservatives, successive freeze\u2212thaw cycles, sample storage at \u221280\u00b0C, and short-term storage at 4 and 20\u00b0C on the quantitative lipoprotein and metabolite patterns were investigated. Storage of plasma samples at 4\u00b0C for up to 48 h, freezing at \u221280\u00b0C and blood sample collection tube choice have few and minor effects on quantitative lipoprotein profiles, and even storage at 4\u00b0C for up to 168 h caused little information loss. In contrast, the impact of heat-treatment (56\u00b0C for 30 min), which has been used for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses, that may be required prior to analytical measurements in low level biosecurity facilities induced marked changes in both lipoprotein and low molecular weight metabolite profiles. It was conclusively demonstrated that this heat inactivation procedure degrades lipoproteins and changes metabolic information in complex ways. Plasma from control individuals and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are differentially altered resulting in the creation of artifactual pseudo-biomarkers and destruction of real biomarkers to the extent that data from heat-treated samples are largely uninterpretable. We also present several simple blood sample handling recommendations for optimal NMR-based biomarker discovery investigations in SARS CoV-2 studies and general clinical biomarker research. for the coordination, sampling and biobanking of patient samples, and clinical metadata.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Advances in clinical diagnosis, prognosis and possible treatment selection are increasingly driven by the use of molecular phenotyping and bioinformatic tools to aid classification of diseases subtypes and to define underlying individual variations in patient biology. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolic profiling of biofluids and tissues and linked data modeling offer possibilities for deep patient phenotyping by generation of detailed chemical fingerprints that can be related to clinical end points and response to therapeutic interventions. 1\u22123 1 H NMR-spectroscopy of biofluids including blood plasma and serum have been widely used to investigate systemic biochemistry in health and disease for decades. 1,4\u22126 Plasma NMR studies, in particular, have proved useful in diabetes, 5, 7 obesity, 8, 9 rheumatoid arthritis, 10 cancers 11 infectious diseases 12 rare diseases, 13, 14 and neurological conditions. 15, 16 Despite previous attempts at method and data harmonization, metabolic phenotyping still does not have uniformly applied standards as the analytical platforms and methods used are often locally optimized for each laboratory or research group. Although frameworks for standardizing measurement reporting have been proposed, 17,18 they do not result in directly statistically comparable data across the community, except perhaps for quantitative NMR spectroscopy. 19 Standardisation of basic sample handling is imperative at the start of the analytical pipeline if data from different laboratories are to be meaningfully compared. There are three mainstream high information content metabolic profiling platforms (gas chromatography (GC)-or liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS), and NMR spectroscopy) and there are many ways to collect, store, prepare and analyze biological samples for such analytical procedures. The impact of method choice on biological interpretation of spectral data sets is further complicated by the selection of statistical analysis methods from a multitude of preprocessing algorithms and statistical pipelines. 20 \u221222 In clinical environments, healthcare workers must, of necessity, prioritise patient safety over research sample collection and availability and handling of research samples are subject to the local clinical capabilities. Moreover, countryspecific regulations can introduce deviations in sample collection and handling procedures. Biosafety sample handling protocols are often required when working with human biofluids in order to contain potentially infectious pathogens that may be present in the sample such as when performing research on the SARS-CoV-2 viral infections. A common practice for viral inactivation in biofluids designated for bioanalysis is to heat samples to 56\u00b0C for 30 min. 23\u221225 Diagnostic metabolic phenotyping signatures of acute and chronic diseases typically incorporate both the lipoprotein and small molecule components observed in the standard one-dimensional (1D) 1 H NMR spectrum. However, utilization of multiple pulse sequences and mathematical fitting methods have evolved to exploit molecular properties to improve the capture of latent biochemical information. More recently, NMR-based lipoproteomics has been used to characterize the unique metabolic signatures of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 26 The NMR based in vitro diagnostic research (IVDr) system was developed to quantify 112 lipoproteins and lipoprotein subfractions and ratios based on regression analysis of the broad terminal CH 3 group peaks centered around \u03b4 = 0.86, the long chain aliphatic (CH 2 ) n signals of the fatty acyl groups centered around \u03b4 = 1.27 and the underlying cholesterol signals. 27 The method follows on from original research by Bell et al., 28 and subsequently Otvos et al. 29 and Ala-Korpela et al. 30 who developed peak shape fitting algorithms to deconvolve contributions from high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) including their subfractions. The lipoproteomic approach utilized and illustrated here involves the analysis of the same NMR signals but relies on a multiple regression model (validated against conventional ultracentrifugation measurements) to create a highly reproducible quantitation tool for lipoproteins. 10 The ability to infer biological significance from metabolic studies is reliant on understanding the limitations of sample collection and handling as well as the biochemical consequences of normal physiological variation from sex, age, ethnicity and lifestyle differences within the population groups. 31,32 This further emphasizes the importance of rigorous study design, sample collection and storage protocols with a set of documented acceptance criteria to ensure sample quality prior to measurement and minimize analytical variation. In a recent study, the comparative multilaboratory performance of 11 separate 600 MHz NMR platforms was evaluated in a ring-trial, which showed high reproducibility and low relative standard deviations well within the acceptance criteria defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) criteria for lipid testing. 33 Storage time, 34 storage temperature, 34 centrifugation, freeze\u2212thaw cycles, 35 serum clotting time, 36 type of collection tube, 36 lyophilization, 37 and sample preservatives 34 have all been shown to impact on the serum or plasma metabolome 38 (Table S1 ). To date, few studies have extensively investigated the impact of sample storage and handling on the quantified lipoprotein panel. However, Wang et al. 35 recently conducted a comprehensive investigation of the variation in lipoprotein fragments after multiple freeze\u2212thaw cycles and found the profile to be generally stable, with the exception of free cholesterol components of the VLDL subclass 1 (V1FC), and free and total cholesterol fraction in intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), IDFC and IDCH, respectively with minor but significant changes in 32 lipoprotein parameters between the first to fifth freeze\u2212thaw (FT) cycle together with an increase in acetate.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 726, "end": 731, "text": "1,4\u22126", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 799, "end": 801, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 802, "end": 803, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 813, "end": 815, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 816, "end": 817, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 892, "end": 895, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 896, "end": 898, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 928, "end": 931, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 932, "end": 934, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1396, "end": 1398, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2094, "end": 2096, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2097, "end": 2100, "text": "\u221222", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2796, "end": 2801, "text": "23\u221225", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3325, "end": 3327, "text": "26", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3695, "end": 3697, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3759, "end": 3761, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3792, "end": 3794, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3818, "end": 3820, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 4309, "end": 4311, "text": "10", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5177, "end": 5179, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 5194, "end": 5196, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 5218, "end": 5220, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 5257, "end": 5259, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 5281, "end": 5283, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 5309, "end": 5311, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 5328, "end": 5330, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 5356, "end": 5358, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 5590, "end": 5592, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 5426, "end": 5435, "text": "(Table S1", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "\u25a0 INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The aim of the current study was to characterize the impact of blood sample collection tubes and sample handling factors on the reproducibility of the lipoprotein and small molecule profiles and quantitation procedures in blood products for real world clinical diagnostics.

A total of 112 lipoprotein parameters for each sample were generated using the Bruker IVDr Lipoprotein Subclass Analysis (B.I.LISA) method. 27 This was obtained by mathematically interrogating and quantifying the -(CH 2 ) n (\u03b4 = 1.25) and \u2212CH 3 (\u03b4 = 0.80) peaks of the 1D spectrum after normalization to the Bruker QuantRef manager within Topspin using a PLS-2 regression model. 27 The lipoprotein data describe chemical components of cholesterol, free cholesterol, phospholipids, triglycerides, Apolipoproteins A1/A2/B100 and the B100/A1 ratio in different density classes: High-density lipoprotein ( Table S2 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 270, "end": 272, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 367, "end": 369, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1347, "end": 1349, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1586, "end": 1588, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1807, "end": 1808, "text": "(", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1809, "end": 1817, "text": "Table S2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "H NMR Acquisition and Data Processing Parameters"}, {"text": "A total of three different spectral data sets were obtained for each sample comprising standard 1D and CPMG spectra and a 2D-Jresolved spectrum. Additionally, quantitative lipoprotein data were derived from the 1D spectra. The 1D and CPMG spectral data sets underwent baseline correction and reference to glucose at \u03b4 = 5.25 using open source MetaboMate software packages 41 operating in the R environment. The regions at \u03b4 = 4.5\u22124.9 containing the residual water resonances and the regions at \u03b4 < 0.5 and > 9.4 containing predominantly noise were excluded from analyses. The resulting 27,818 spectral data points for the standard 1D and CPMG were normalized using a probabilistic quotient method 42 to account for subtle variations between samples due to analytical variability during the analysis, meancentered and unit-variance scaling applied prior to multivariate modeling. An unsupervised multivariate data analysis approach, principal components analysis (PCA), 43 was initially used to describe the underlying systematic variation in quantitative lipoprotein, 1D and CMPG spectral data sets for spectral data under investigation. To interrogate further the effects of different sample storage/handling, additional analyses were performed separately for each experimental condition. For each condition, a separate PCA model was constructed. Orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) 44 was used to identify metabolites differentiating between sample conditions. The OPLS-DA model validity was assessed using leave-one-out cross validation procedure and the Q 2 Y statistic was used to describe the proportion of variance explained by the predictive component for the experimental condition. In addition, univariate statistics were used to assess group differences in the quantitative lipoprotein data. This included the use of Cliff's Delta statistic, a nonparametric effect size measure that quantifies differences between two conditions. A Cliff's Delta of +1 or \u22121 denotes the absence of overlap while 0 denotes complete overlap between the two groups. To test for statistical significance, a two-tailed paired Wilcoxon Rank Sum or Kruskal\u2212Wallis Rank Sum statistic, as appropriate, was applied and no correction for multiple hypothesis testing was performed due to the interdependence of the measured lipoprotein parameters. Here, a statistical significance level was fixed at \u03b1 = 0.05. Specifically, for the heating experiment, a hierarchical cluster analysis using the Ward criterion 45 Figure S1a ) and 46.0% for the lipoproteins ( Figure S1b ). The data structure of all of these data sets was clearly different; the 1D spectrum contains information on all molecular components, but was dominated by proteins and lipoproteins; the CPMG spin\u2212echo amplifies the detection of molecular species with long T 2 relaxation times including small molecules and flexible moieties from macromolecules such as the N-acetyl Variation introduced by either sample storage or handling was apparent in lower PCs with some influence from interindividual variation still contributing to the variance in the PC2, accounting for 16% of the total variance (1D), 8.0% (CPMG) and 17.2% (lipoprotein panel). Since information on both experimental and biological effects was embedded in the PCA model, it was necessary to minimize the extraneous variation introduced into the data set by experimental conditions in order to extract clear metabolic differences arising from the biological condition under investigation. Given the scale of the interindividual biochemical differences in all three data sets (1D, CPMG and lipoprotein), systematic analytical effects can easily be obscured and may impair extraction of biomarker information. Therefore, the variance introduced by altering each experimental parameter (heating, freezing, time to acquisition at room and refrigerated temperatures, blood collection tubes) was compared by characterizing the difference between the standard sample handling condition or acquisition protocol 27, 39 and procedures under assessment. In order to visualize the relative influence of each sample storage or handling condition, the difference in the spectra or lipoproteins were compared to the standard experimental conditions (see Methods) and calculated (see Supporting Information). The mean group effect for each treatment (heating, freeze\u2212thawing, time stored at 4 and 20\u00b0C prior to spectral acquisition) is expressed as a vector (see Section S1 Data Analysis for information) in Figure 3 . Each vector has a magnitude, representing the mean scale of effect, and a direction that reflects the mean change in spectral profile or lipoprotein panel. The effect of heating on the plasma sample, as expected, exerted the greatest effect as illustrated by the vector plots for the 1D and CPMG data sets. Storage of the sample at 4\u00b0C for 168 h prior to sample preparation caused a lesser shift in the same direction as heating, whereas the freeze\u2212thawing vector oriented in the opposite direction to the heating vector in the 1D spectral data set scores plot and was orthogonal to the heating vector for the CPMG data set. The difference between fresh versus frozen, or between one and three freeze\u2212thaw cycles was, as expected, much lower than that the compositional differences attributed to heating. Similarly, with the lipoprotein data, changes introduced by repeated freeze\u2212thaw cycles were minor in comparison to heating or refrigerated storage for extended periods of time. These changes were partially mitigated when plasma samples were prepared in buffer and were stored in the refrigerated NMR automatic sample changer, indicating that the buffer helped stabilize the samples.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 372, "end": 374, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 697, "end": 699, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 969, "end": 971, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1413, "end": 1415, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 2520, "end": 2522, "text": "45", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 4045, "end": 4048, "text": "27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 4049, "end": 4051, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2523, "end": 2533, "text": "Figure S1a", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2569, "end": 2579, "text": "Figure S1b", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 4534, "end": 4542, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Data Analysis"}, {"text": "In order to explore the effects further, pairwise comparisons were conducted for each sample preparation or measurement factor.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Data Analysis"}, {"text": "Since the first SARS infectious disease in 2002/2003 in China, thermal inactivation of virus at 56\u00b0C for 20\u221230 min was found to be effective in reducing the virus titer to the detection limit. 46 Incubating samples at 56\u00b0C for 10 min, has been shown to completely denature the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV 46 and similarly heating plasma at 56\u00b0C for 25 min reduced >4 log 10 TCID 50 /mL of MERS virus, 47 where TCID 50 represents the median tissue culture infectious dose. Since heat treatment has been recommended for viral inactivation, and there is a reported study 48 which demonstrated the generation of false negative results, we therefore compared the effect of heating on the 1 H NMR-derived lipoprotein profile, CPMG and 1D spectral data sets. Heating samples at 56\u00b0C for 30 min caused major changes across all three spectral data sets. The difference in composition pre-and postheating was calculated for each sample and is illustrated in Figure 4a for the lipoprotein data, where each pre-and postheating pair mapped closely in the PCA scores but showed a definite shift in the PC space postheating. The comparable PCA and scatter plots for the 1D and CPMG spectra demonstrated a similar trend (Figures S2 and S3a,b) . Notably, the net vector direction postheating was different in the control and SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals, so the degradation effects are nonequivalent rendering any differential diagnostic information invalid postheating (Figure 4b) . A degree of dispersion was evident in the SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and healthy volunteer classes for both the lipoproteins and the CPMG spectra indicating a nonuniform alteration in the chemical composition of the serum samples after heat-treatment (Figures 4b and S3 ).
