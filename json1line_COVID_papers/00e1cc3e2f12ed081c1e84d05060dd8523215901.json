These results indicated that active nucleases were present in the heat inactivated saliva samples. To prevent further degradation of RNA that could result in false-negative tests, various RNase inhibitors were tested both in the sample preparation and the RT-LAMP master mix. The following RNase inhibitors were evaluated: NEB RNase inhibitor murine, Invitrogen SUPERase\u00b7In, and Invitrogen RNaseOUT Recombinant Ribonuclease Inhibitor. Only RNaseOUT at a final concentration of 30 units per reaction was consistently inhibit nuclease activity in direct saliva RT-LAMP at the optimum incubation temperature of 65\u00b0C.
