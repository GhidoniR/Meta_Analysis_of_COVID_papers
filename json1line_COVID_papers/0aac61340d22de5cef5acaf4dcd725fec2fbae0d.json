First, we demonstrated that ACE2-Fc could specifically abrogate virus replication by blocking the entry of SARS-CoV-2 spike-expressing pseudotyped virus into both ACE2-expressing lung cells and lung organoids. The impairment of viral entry was not affected by virus variants, since efficient inhibition was also observed in six SARS-CoV-2 clinical strains, including the D614G variants which have been shown to exhibit increased infectivity. The preservation of peptidase activity also enables ACE2-Fc to reduce the angiotensin II-mediated cytokine cascade. Furthermore, this Fc domain of ACE2-Fc was shown to activate NK cell degranulation after coincubation with Spike-expressing H1975 cells. These promising characteristics potentiate the therapeutic prospects of ACE2-Fc as an effective treatment for COVID-19.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "In December 2019, a new coronavirus, reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, and later named SARS-CoV-2, was classified as a new member of the beta-coronavirus family (Guan et al, 2020; Huang et al, 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 causes atypical pneumonia and apparently spreads more efficiently than SARS-CoV did in 2003 and MERS-CoV did in 2015 (de Wit et al, 2016) . Currently, there were more than 47 million confirmed cases, with 1.2 million deaths till November 2020 globally (https://www.who.int/). SARS-CoV infection is mediated by the transmembrane glycoprotein Spike, which recognizes and targets angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry (Zhou et al, 2020) . The viral Spike protein can be divided into two functionally distinct subunits, a receptor-binding subunit S1 and a membrane-fusion subunit S2. The S1 subunit recognizes and binds to ACE2 on host cells, while the fusogenic peptide on the S2 subunit facilitates fusion between the viral and host membrane to facilitate the release of the viral genome into the host cells (Tortorici & Veesler, 2019) . Based on the viral sequence alignment (Lu et al, 2020) as well as the Cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein , high similarities between the Spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have been described (Monteil et al, 2020) . Recently, it was reported that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 S1, similar to that of SARS-CoV, interacts with the peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2 (Li et al, 2005; Wrapp et al, 2020) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 174, "end": 192, "text": "(Guan et al, 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 193, "end": 211, "text": "Huang et al, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 342, "end": 362, "text": "(de Wit et al, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 657, "end": 675, "text": "(Zhou et al, 2020)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1048, "end": 1075, "text": "(Tortorici & Veesler, 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1116, "end": 1132, "text": "(Lu et al, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1287, "end": 1308, "text": "(Monteil et al, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1472, "end": 1488, "text": "(Li et al, 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1489, "end": 1507, "text": "Wrapp et al, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "ACE2 is expressed on the cell membrane of most organs and tissues, including the lungs, heart, kidney, brain, intestine, and endothelial cells (Kabbani & Olds, 2020) . As a component involved in the signaling pathway of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which functions as a homeostatic regulator of vascular function, ACE2 plays an important role in the maturation of angiotensin (Ang), which controls vasoconstriction, blood pressure (Patel et al, 2016) , and the inflammatory cytokine cascade mediated by TNF-a and IL-6 (Hirano & Murakami, 2020) . ACE first metabolizes Ang I to Ang II, whose C-terminal domain is further cleaved by ACE2 to generate angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7). Ang 1-7, having opposing functions to Ang II, has been shown to exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects upon lung and heart injury (Patel et al, 2016) . The concentration of Ang II is delicately regulated. Increased levels of Ang II are believed to upregulate ACE2 activity, which subsequently leads to decreased Ang II and increased Ang 1-7 levels. Treatment with recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) and B38-CAP, a bacteria-derived ACE2-like enzyme, has been reported to suppress Ang II-induced hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis in the mouse model (Liu et al, 2018; Minato et al, 2020) . In addition, ACE2 was shown to improve sepsis-induced acute lung injury using cecal ligation and perforation (CLP) and endotoxin challenge . In addition, impaired ACE2 expression was observed in mice receiving an intraperitoneal injection of SARS-CoV Spike protein, suggesting that the Spike proteins might worsen lung injury by hijacking ACE2 function and reducing its expression levels . Thus, ACE2 plays a key role in protecting organs from injury other than serving as the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (Hirano & Murakami, 2020) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 143, "end": 165, "text": "(Kabbani & Olds, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 438, "end": 457, "text": "(Patel et al, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 525, "end": 550, "text": "(Hirano & Murakami, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 821, "end": 840, "text": "(Patel et al, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1249, "end": 1266, "text": "(Liu et al, 2018;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1267, "end": 1286, "text": "Minato et al, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1796, "end": 1821, "text": "(Hirano & Murakami, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Four potential strategies have been developed to combat SARS-CoV-2 entry, including Spike protein-based vaccine, inhibition of transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) activity, therapeutic antibodies blocking the interactions between ACE2 and the Spike protein, and soluble ACE2 (Kruse, 2020; Zhang et al, 2020) .

The ectodomain of human ACE2, residues 18-615, was also constructed with a fused Fc region of human IgG1 at the C-terminus and IL-2 secretion signaling peptide at the N-terminus to facilitate secretion of ACE2-Fc out of the cells (Fig EV1A) . This soluble ACE2-Fc chimeric region could be specifically recognized by the anti-ACE2 antibody (Fig EV1B) . The ACE2-Fc and Spike 1-674-Fc can individually form a stable homodimer (Fig 1C and D) . The ACE2-Fc and Spike 1-674-Fc protein are likely to be heavily N-glycosylated since size reduction was observed in SDS-PAGE after PNGase F (Peptide: N-glycosidase F) treatment (Fig 1E and F) . ELISA was subsequently performed to examine whether this purified ACE2-Fc antibody could bind to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike. ACE2-Fc was further modified with monomer D-biotin at its C-terminus by an Avi-tag affinity process ( Fig EV1C) . As shown in Fig EV2A and B , ACE2-Fc-Biotin, as the functional receptor, could interact with the Spike 1-674 and the Spike 319-591 truncated proteins. The ACE2-Fc-Biotin/Spike S1 interaction could be disrupted by a 20-fold excess of unlabeled ACE2-Fc or the Spike S1 subunit in a dose-dependent manner (Figs 2A and EV2C) . In addition, ACE2-Fc could bind to the cell surface of human lung adenocarcinoma H1975 cells expressing fulllength Spike protein in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig 2B) . The colocalization of the FITC-conjugated ACE2-Fc and anti-Spike antibody by confocal microscopy further confirm the specific recognition of the Spike proteins by the ACE2-Fc (Fig 2C) . Using a fluorescent peptide substrate (Mca-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-Ala-Pro-Lys(Dnp)-OH) (Enari et al, 1996) , we demonstrated that the purified ACE2-Fc retained peptidase activity as compared with the human normal IgG and buffer controls ( Fig 2D) . The effects of ACE2-Fc on Ang II-mediated inflammatory cascade were subsequently investigated. After the co-incubation of Ang II with ACE2-Fc, we observed that ACE2-Fc could significantly suppress Ang II-induced TNF-a production ( Fig 2E) and phosphorylation of ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17) ( Fig 2F) .

After the specific interactions between antibodies or Fc fusion proteins with specific antigens on the cell surface of infected cells, cross-linking of the Fc domain will activate the CD16 (FccRIII) receptor to trigger degranulation (CD107a on the cell membrane) and cytokine production (IFN-c and TNF-a) of NK cells (McDonald et al, 2015; Sun et al, 2019) . A recent report showed that the RBD-specific antibodies from an individual infected with SARS-CoV in 2003 could induce nearly 10% ADCC against SARS-CoV-2 (Pinto et al, 2020) . Therefore, experiments were conducted to examine whether ACE2-Fc could induce primary human NK cell activation. H1975 cells, transduced with fulllength Spike by the lentiviral vector (H1975-Spike), were used as target cells (Fig 7A) . The NK cell degranulation assay was performed to determine the CD107a, IFN-c, and TNF-a expression levels after the co-incubation of the NK cells with H1975-Spike cells in the presence of ACE2-Fc or recombinant ACE2 (1-740 A.A. without an Fc tag).

After Ang II binds to its receptor AT1R, it can activate ADAM17 and NF-jB (Esteban et al, 2004) . ADAM17 phosphorylation can further facilitate the maturation of IL-6 and TNF-a from their precursor forms (Hirano & Murakami, 2020) . Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 infection might cause cytokine storms in COVID-19 patients, which is likely to be prevented by the restoration of ACE2 peptidase activity. In our study, we demonstrated that expression of a shorter ACE2 fragment (18-615 A.A.) can specifically and efficiently block SARS-CoV-1 infection, while still preserving its peptidase activity (Fig 2D-F) . Based on the previous findings in mouse ACE2 (Wysocki et al, 2019) , two shorten mouse ACE2 variants (1-605 and 1-619 A.A.) were shown to exhibit higher ACE2 enzyme activity than that of the full-length ACE2 (1-740 A.A.). In addition, ACE2 enzyme activity could be detected in urine from ACE2 knockout mice after intravenous infusion of the mouse variant (1-619 A.A.), but not ACE2 (1-740 A.A.). Infusion of this short variant (ACE2 1-619 A.A.) also recovered the ACE2 activity of the kidney in the Ace2-deficient mice. These evidences supported that the shortened version of the mouse ACE2-Fc (1-619 A.A.) is more stable in plasma and retains higher enzyme activity to convert Ang II to Ang 1-7. The decoy antibody ACE2-Fc designed in this study is a shorten version of ACE2 (18-615), similar to that in the mouse ACE2 study (Wysocki et al, 2019) . Our study results clearly demonstrated that in addition to block the entry and subsequent infection of host cells by the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses as well as the SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates, the ACE2-Fc (18-615 A.A.) fusion protein is very stable in plasma up to 10 days and also preserve its peptidase activity to exert its regulator effects on immune responses (Figs 6 and 7) . The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a hormone system that regulates vascular function, including the regulation of blood pressure, natriuresis, and blood volume control (Tikellis & Thomas, 2012) . As a key regulator in the RAS, ACE2 acts by converting Ang II into Ang 1-7 (Gheblawi et al, 2020) . Ang II can also downregulate ACE2 expression through AT1R when the RAS is overactivated in cardiovascular disease through the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways (Koka et al, 2008) . Three strategies have been evolved to reduce Ang II levels upon RAS overactivation, including ACE inhibitors (ACEis), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers (Gheblawi et al, 2020) . Most of these compounds increase the protein and mRNA levels of ACE2 or peptidase activity in animal models (Kai & Kai, 2020) . Being known as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, we speculate that ARBs-or ACEis-induced ACE2 upregulation may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the administration of recombinant ACE2 or ACE2-Fc could augment ACE2 enzymatic activity and reduce systemic inflammation. A lower plasma Ang II level after taking recombinant ACE2 may be safe in healthy volunteers and patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome or pulmonary arterial hypertension as demonstrated in the previous pilot studies (Haschke et al, 2013; Khan et al, 2017; Hemnes et al, 2018) . Therefore, for RAS disorder patients with COVID-19 treatment, administration of ACE2-Fc in circulation may block SARS-CoV-2 infection even in those subjects with induced ACE2 after receipt of ARBs or ACEis treatment. Nevertheless, it should be noted that similar to ARBs and ACEis, administration of ACE2-Fc may be harmful to the developing fetus during pregnancy since it could lower blood pressure by converting Ang II to Ang 1-7.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 219, "end": 240, "text": "(Esteban et al, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 349, "end": 374, "text": "(Hirano & Murakami, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 790, "end": 811, "text": "(Wysocki et al, 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1571, "end": 1592, "text": "(Wysocki et al, 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2146, "end": 2171, "text": "(Tikellis & Thomas, 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2249, "end": 2271, "text": "(Gheblawi et al, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2439, "end": 2457, "text": "(Koka et al, 2008)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2656, "end": 2678, "text": "(Gheblawi et al, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2789, "end": 2806, "text": "(Kai & Kai, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3310, "end": 3331, "text": "(Haschke et al, 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3332, "end": 3349, "text": "Khan et al, 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3350, "end": 3369, "text": "Hemnes et al, 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 732, "end": 742, "text": "(Fig 2D-F)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1958, "end": 1972, "text": "(Figs 6 and 7)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The ADCC process is initiated by the interaction of the antibody with the virus antigen of infected cells, which subsequently leads to the cross-linking of the CD16 receptors on NK cells.
