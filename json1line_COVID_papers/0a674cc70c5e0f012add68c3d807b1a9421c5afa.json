According to the results, it can be argued that the presence of more men in the outdoor environment is the cause of more exposure and an increase in the rate of infection and death (in Iran, the presence of men outside the home is more likely than women).

The eastern areas with a high density of residential land-use, central and northern regions with a high density of administrative-commercial land-use, respectively, have the highest number of COVD-19 cases. As a result, they have more deaths, but in the western high-density industrial districts, the number of patients is lower than in other regions (Figs. 5, 7 and Table 1 ). There is a direct relationship between the area of the houses and the infected rate to COVID-19; most of the infected live in houses with an area of fewer than 100 m. The results of this study showed that most of the patients in their family did not have an infected person and often were family members of 3 people.

Conversely, the more we go to the northern regions, the infected patients to COVID-19 are increasing, which can be directly related to the economic situation of these areas. Non-referral to medical centers due to unfavorable economic conditions has been the reason for the lower number of patients in the southern and southwestern regions compared to the northern areas. Inversely, the number of patients in the northern regions was high due to better economic ability and more visits to medical centers. In Iran, medical expenses are very high compared to income. In general, the average annual net cost and income for an urban household was 479.946 and 515.35 million Rials in Tehran (2017), respectively. Also, the price of the dollar varied between 30,000 and 50,000 Rials during 2017, and the same price for the dollar in 2020 reached over 300,000 Rials in Iran. It has increased almost ten times compared to the previous three years, which in turn has reduced people's economic ability. However, people's incomes haven't risen over the past three years, which affected families with weaker economies. It seems that if the economic situation of the people is better, the number of patients would be proportionally higher, which is due to the number of visits to medical centers. If we look at the data in Table 1 , we find that the highest mortality rate was in the southern and central regions of Tehran, which have a weaker economy than the northern parts of the city. Also, these areas are facing environmental pollution, including air pollution, noise pollution, and traffic, more than other regions.
