The previously reported reinfections with SARS-CoV-2 have been either entirely asymptomatic [3, 9] , less severe [5] , like in our patient, or more severe [4, [6] [7] [8] in relation to the initial episode. Since reinfection cases are usually noticed because of clinical symptoms, there is likely a reporting bias towards symptomatic cases and post-infection immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may generally protect from severe illness. This is supported by a recent study which demonstrated that seropositive healthcare workers had a substantially reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in the six months following the initial infection [25] . However, correlates of protection remain to be established and it is currently unknown whether the mode of reinfection (e.g., overwhelmingly high titers of SARS-CoV-2, virus-intrinsic virulence), the magnitude, breadth, and quality of the humoral immune responses, waning T-cell immunity or other viral or host factors alone or in combination allow for reinfections [26] . According to recently published case definitions for confirmed SARS-CoV-2 reinfections, viral RNA sequencing is required to differentiate a true reinfection by distinct viral variants from prolonged viral shedding or a reactivation of a lingering virus infection [10, 27] . While it has been shown that in most patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNA is undetectable four weeks after the onset of symptoms, prolonged PCR-positivity of up to 104 days after the initial infection has been reported [28, 29] . We demonstrate that the same person was infected with SARS-CoV-2 in March 2020 and was reinfected 282 days after the first positive qRT-PCR with a different viral lineage (19A and 20 EU1 respectively). The SARS-CoV-2 sequences retrieved from both infections matched the epidemiology of the typical clades circulating in Germany during the respective time without any additional changes in the essential parts of the spike gene associated with immune escape. Moderate levels of SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG and an NT (IC50) antibody assay were observed after the initial infection. Those were comparable to levels detectable after a mild clinical course of COVID-19 or two weeks after a single injection of an mRNA vaccine [30] . The current reinfection episode was associated with only a few symptoms and was detected only after a routine screening of exposed healthcare workers at our hospital [31] . It resulted in a strong (approximate factor of 10) boost of antibody levels in both the quantitative anti-spike (S1/S2) IgG and in a 4-fold titer increase in the NT (IC50) antibody assay. Notably, the peak virus titer at the time of reinfection was not reduced compared to the initial infection, but the virus was cleared rapidly and was below the limit of detection of diagnostic qRT-PCR after nine days. There is currently little knowledge about the level and quality of humoral immune responses that can render protection from clinical disease, and a better understanding about reinfection events may help to identify serological correlates of immunity. Further studies are needed to investigate whether vaccination after COVID-19 or reinfection reliably boosts the SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses to levels where sterilizing immunity and longer lasting protection from clinical disease and transmission are achieved.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 212, "end": 216, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 217, "end": 220, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 315, "end": 318, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 319, "end": 321, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 336, "end": 339, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 378, "end": 381, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 382, "end": 385, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 386, "end": 389, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 390, "end": 393, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 849, "end": 853, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1222, "end": 1226, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1492, "end": 1496, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1497, "end": 1500, "text": "27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1710, "end": 1714, "text": "[28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1715, "end": 1718, "text": "29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2435, "end": 2439, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2608, "end": 2612, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The presented case of a SARS-CoV-2 reinfection of an immunocompetent patient in a high-risk healthcare setting indicates that a moderate immune response after the first infection rather than viral escape did allow for the reinfection.
