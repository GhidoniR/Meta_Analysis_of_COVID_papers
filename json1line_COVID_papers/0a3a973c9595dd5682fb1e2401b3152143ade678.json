Due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the sudden shift to remote instruction in the spring of 2020, many instructors of such courses found themselves struggling to identify strategies for developing rigorous field activities that could be completed online, solo, and from a student's backyard. This case study illustrates the process by which one field-based course, a UC California Naturalist certification course offered at the University of California, Davis, transitioned to fully remote instruction. The transition relied on established, publicly available, online participatory science platforms (e.g., iNaturalist) to which the students contributed data and field observations remotely. Student feedback on the course and voluntary-continued engagement with the participatory science platforms indicates that the student perspective of the experience was on par with previous traditional offerings of the course.

Through capstone projects, students demonstrate competence in a specific topic through the design, initiation, and completion of an environmental service project in support of a local education, conservation, participatory science, or program support initiative. Capstone projects serve two educational goals: (1) incorporating student-driven course content, which has been shown to increase student motivation toward and engagement with fieldwork (Pawson & Teather, 2002) , and (2) promoting long-term activity in the CalNat community by exposing students to volunteerism and community service opportunities.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 858, "end": 882, "text": "(Pawson & Teather, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| Description and educational value"}, {"text": "Under traditional in-person instruction, capstone projects were a mix of data collection for management purposes (e.g., water quality measurements in the UCD Arboretum and Public Garden waterway), Under remote instruction, capstone projects needed to be coordinated and completed solo and exclusively online.

Many students completed this activity without leaving their yard; indeed, the smaller spatial scale inspired additional creativity for some of the more uncommon scavenger hunt items. The second of these activities was an audio identification activity for local birds. This activity was developed specifically because several students had commented in their first sit spot observation that they heard birds they could not identify. The instructor brought in a guest speaker who has experience in teaching 'birding by ear' to help students practice describing bird calls and identifying common birds solely by their sounds. The activity for the week then focused on audio recordings from the students' sit spot in which they identified bird calls, other biotic sounds (e.g., squirrels), and anthropogenic sounds (e.g., cars, construction).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| Traditional and remote implementation"}, {"text": "Each class session began with a group presentation over the previous week's activity. Under traditional instruction, these presentations were done via the classroom audiovisual setup and focused on summarizing the class data or observations. Under remote instruction, group presentations occurred via Zoom; students needed to unmute and speak to the group, but did not need to turn on their webcams. Students whose Internet bandwidth was not reliably able to screenshare sent their presentation to the instructor who shared it for them. Given the asynchronous structure of the activities under remote instruction, most group presentations focused on the students' own contributions to the activity, since students were not completing the activity at the same time together. Under both forms of instruction, participatory science projects with data reporting tools allowed students to compare observations or data generated by the class to previously reported data from the region. While bias in student evaluations is well documented (Stark & Freishtat, 2014) , many of the triggers of bias (such as those relating to instructor identity) were the same between the 2019 and 2020 cohorts; the most influential exceptions being response percentage (which was lower in 2020), and the slight change in wording of UCD campus evaluation questions (Table 2) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1034, "end": 1059, "text": "(Stark & Freishtat, 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1341, "end": 1350, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "| Traditional and remote implementation"}, {"text": "Anonymous end-of-course student evaluations indicate the 2020 remote instruction experience was on par with the 2019 traditional instruction experience in terms of student engagement (Table 2, Figure 3 ).
