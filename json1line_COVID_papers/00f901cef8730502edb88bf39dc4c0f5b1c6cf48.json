Therefore, organizations need to prepare for emergent behaviors by embedding corrective control mechanisms, which help coordinate organization-wide behavior (and goals) with the behavior of local autonomous entities. Ongoing technological advances, brought by the Industry 4.0 and cyber-physical systems of systems paradigms, can support integration within complex enterprises, such as supply chains. In this paper, we propose a reference enterprise architecture for the detection and monitoring of emergent behaviors in enterprises. We focus on addressing the need for an adequate reaction to disruptions. Based on a systematic review of the literature on the topic of current architectural designs for understanding emergent behaviors, we distill architectural requirements. Our architecture is a hybrid as it combines distributed autonomous business logic (expressed in terms of simple business rules) and some central control mechanisms. We exemplify the instantiation and use of this architecture by means of a proof-of-concept implementation, using a multimodal logistics case study. The obtained results provide a basis for achieving supply chain resilience \"by design\", i.e., through the design of coordination mechanisms that are well equipped to absorb and compensate for the effects of emergent disruptive behaviors.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Though today's enterprises are becoming increasingly resilient against unprecedented and unpredictable forms of disruption, the changing and uncertain nature of the real world continues to severely affect society.

This means, it can take any form, ranging from a subdivision of a single organization up to any network of businesses (e.g., a supply chain) operating according to any coordination achieving a common business goal. As such, organizations have become complex socio-technical systems of heterogeneous systems (e.g., system of systems) that pursue their own-sometimes conflicting-goals, behaviors, functions, and requirements. The behavior executed by such local autonomous entities may, however, conflict with the system-wide goals. Despite these occasionally conflicting behaviors and goals, enterprises should have the ability to cope with emerging threats and to adapt to turbulent environments, while satisfying stakeholders' needs. For example, organizations are encouraged to implement mechanisms to support their absorptive capacity [7] .

We are shifting towards a System of Systems (SoS) mindset, in which the consideration is no longer merely the computer or human, but interconnected Constituent Systems (CSs) [8] . An SoS is an \"integration of a finite number of constituent systems which are independent and operable and which are networked together for a time to achieve a certain higher goal\" [9] . A CS is \"an autonomous subsystem of an SoS, consisting of computer systems and possibly of controlled objects and/or human role players that interact to provide a given service\" [10] . Such CSs operate autonomously and may need to change their plans continuously based on the SoS's situation. Instead of managing a whole SoS holistically and in a fully predictable manner, CSs have their own goals and planning that enables them to act on emergent behaviors as soon as they arise. To be able to make an SoS resilient against disruptions, micro-behaviors as modeled in CSs, should be balanced against the higher-level (macro)behaviors of the SoS.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 537, "end": 540, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 724, "end": 727, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 908, "end": 912, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "An awareness of the physical environment is crucial in that regard.

Therefore, it is not enough anymore to study sources of emergent behaviors in isolation. Disruptive emergent behaviors may be identified and monitored on a near-physical level at one CS, which can be important for another CS. Thereby, we arrive at the notion of a Cyber-Physical System (CPS). A CPS comprises interconnected, yet autonomous, physical assets and computational capabilities [11] . This means the joint dynamics of SoS and CPS should be studied together, and this is what sets the emerging discipline of Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems (CPSoSs) apart from these individually established fields.

To this end, the enterprise architecture (EA) discipline can help organizations to steer toward the desired state that embeds the CPS and SoS requirements. EA deals with the description of an enterprise from an integrated business and IT perspective that is intended to narrow the gap between business and IT stakeholders and improve business and IT alignment [12] . However, classic EA models fall short in this respect, as EA models give a rather high-level static abstraction of business and IT components. More recently, attention has been paid to physical components. EA modeling languages such as ArchiMate [13] , recently adopted concepts to also describe entities in the physical domain [14] . The extension with concepts for Operation Technology (OT) modeling allows the describing of emergent behaviors that are close to established (physical) workflows. That is, it becomes possible to use EA models to adapt organizations to measure and optimize the recovery before or during the occurrence of a disruption at the physical layer. Later, suitable mitigation strategies can be incorporated into the different layers of an enterprise, enabling the movement beyond the survival of disruptions only and the achievement of true business-IT-OT alignment. For example, by embracing adaptive EAs and advanced decision support systems, an enterprise can gain from emergent behaviors instead of suffering losses. We advise that, the sooner emergent behaviors are detected, the sooner preventive measures can be taken to ensure the resilience of business processes execution.

For example, the local actor's behaviors can be reflected in the business logic of logistics entities such as smart cargo or autonomous driving vehicles. Another reason for the special attention to this domain is that we contribute to the research line focusing on supply chain logistics, as stipulated in a doctoral research plan of Bemthuis [26] .

When focusing on the consequences and prediction of emergent behaviors of a CPSoS, we can distinguish expected versus unexpected emergence and beneficial, neutral, and harmful emergence, as shown in Table 1 . Detecting and avoiding an unexpected detrimental emergent phenomenon is problematic [10] .

In turn, understanding self-organization, entanglement, and emergence could make a key contribution in forging innovations [32] . In this line of thinking, we foresee that a complex sociotechnical SoS, such as a CPSoS, empowers our envisioned united relationship between the cyber space and physical world, and, consequently, give rise to modeling new approaches for understanding emergent behavior. We do not expect that CPSoS alone will provide an all-encompassing type of solution to all challenges regarding emergence, especially not regarding the tackling of strong emergence (and of many simpler forms of emergence). However, it may enable new forms of macro-and micro-level features inherited from emergent processes.

The term resilience has also been used in a narrower sense, referring to the ability to return to an equilibrium state after a disturbance. This viewpoint can also be named as stability [38] or engineering resilience [39] . Notice that engineering resilience in complex systems suggests that a disruption can bring a system over a threshold that marks the limit of the stability domain of the original state [40] . As such, complex systems, such as CPSoS that exhibit multiple CSs, can cause the system to be attracted to a different state. In this narrower definition, the focus is more on the system's ability to return to a convenient state following disruptions, while it would also be interesting to resist change in the face of disturbance.

This definition stresses on threats that can undermine a system, implying the involvement of risk management. In the context of disaster management, resilience can include readiness, response, and recovery strategies [42] .

We devote a special attention to the notion of resilience with respect to this requirement. Objectives can be expressed in terms of goal functions which could be specific resilience metrics in a CPSoS. The use of objective functions is an approach to assess the CPSoS functionality and capabilities in an attempt to control the resilience of an enterprise. Choosing and measuring some metrics for a specific context can lead to resilience gains. Such metrics may be qualitative or quantitative, external or internal, short-term or long-term focused, and can be tailored to specific resilience aspects (e.g., readiness, response, and recovery).

One of the main distinctions between our reference model and the existing models is that we focus on the detecting and monitoring of emergence, from a functional architectural perspective. While languages such as SysML, CML, and UML are commonly used when specifying and designing SoS architectures, we decided to use ArchiMate [13] for modeling the EA, as our main focus is not per se on system design, but rather on capturing emergent behaviors and their management mechanisms in the broader organizational context of business operations and process execution. We aim to support modeling, reasoning, and model-based (quantitative) analysis of the functional components in an architectural blueprint. To this end, the ArchiMate language provides a rich modeling expression, ranging from motivation aspects (such as requirements and goals) to system design aspects (such as application landscapes and their corresponding IT and physical infrastructure). Therefore, ArchiMate models provide anchors to other domain specific languages (e.g., BPMN, UML, SysML, etc.), that might be needed for a possible further refinement of some parts of the proposed architecture and for future extensions and derived instantiations of the reference architecture. ArchiMate is also a commonly used modeling language and framework and perceived as the de facto standard for EA modeling [113] . Figure 3 proposes an EA based on the positioned requirements. The EA shows four layers as well as the relationships within and across the layers.

This modeling technique is suitable for analyzing such autonomous and distributed systems, because it can capture emergence and it provides a natural description of a SoS system [78] . A study of Singh et al. [118] already showed that agent-based systems is an effective way to explore emergent behaviors. In particular, we use an agent-based simulation model for understanding the emergent behaviors.

Figure 10 presents some experiment results focusing on (i) and (ii). The graphs display the average product end decay (in %) and average cycle time (in minutes) of a single simulation run for four disruption mitigation scenarios. The numbers depict average outcomes based on realized products (e.g., products that leave the system) within a 10 min interval. The first hour is neglected, due to a warm-up period. Below, we discuss these results. Figure 10a shows the normal behavior, without an expected (detrimental) disruption. As we can observe, the results tend to become reasonably stable after a couple of hours. In the second scenario ( Figure 10b ), we invoked a disruption after 6 h. The disruption entails a travel speed decrease of all automated guided vehicles by 75%. The results indicate that both performance indicators are substantially impacted. The product decay level dropped from roughly 95% to 78% and the average cycle time of a product increased from approximately 260 to 310 s.

Here, the disruption has been partially repelled. Nevertheless, in comparison to Figure 10b , the impact can still be considered as disruptive. In this scenario, the decay level dropped to 83% and the cycle time increased to roughly 290 min.

This can partly be explained by the use of the same random seed values in the simulation model. Figure 10d goes one step further, by already using the mitigation strategy one hour before the disruption will occur. We just assumed that there is a certain emergence detection mechanisms, which was capable to proactively detect that a disruption will occur.

In the view of emergent behaviors, we observed that the various CSs work together, cause emergence (as expressed with a realized KPI), and achieve a \"higher\" goal by interacting. In the light of enterprise resilience, the presented scenarios indicate what emergent behaviors are realized by the system. The illustrative scenarios suggest that we can define actions (e.g., change in business logic) that affect a particular emergent behavior. This can imply that the CSs within the CPSoS can reorganize, change, and learn using capabilities to absorb the impact.

One may incorporate design decisions for this EA instance within a broader decision framework model for SoSs, such as the one illustrated by Raman and D'Souza [69] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 849, "end": 853, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions and Future Work"}, {"text": "The outcome of this work can also spark new research interests. We can explore the possibility of having enterprises self-adapt to contextual changes, thereby more closely embracing the CPS paradigm as well as becoming a time-and self-aware architecture. Another direction would be to integrate the architecture with a SoS dynamic architecture, also including security aspects. Furthermore, we only addressed a case study and instantiation of the proposed EA. The proposed reference architecture may also be applicable to other use cases and industries to evaluate the accuracy of the conclusions discussed above. For example, in further work one may explore different micro-macro integration strategies. A real-life multimodal logistics case study integrated with the smart grid may be an interesting next step. Furthermore, more research is needed on emergent behavior detecting, monitoring, and managing. To this end, analysis of simulations could provide key insights into emergent behaviors of the CPSoS. We also recommend more research on the concept of enterprise resilience and associated terms, such as (anti)fragility, robustness, and flexibility in the context of an enterprise CPSoS. Last, further explorations to leverage united CPSoS, Industry 4.0, and IoT implications by embedding the human's expertise may be a promising next step. Refined collaborative interactions between humans and CSs inspired from the Industry 5.0 vision, can amplify the human and SoS intelligence to meet the uncertain nature and complexity of the real world.

Adapted from the work in[10].\u2022 Type I: nominal or intentional emergence is fully predictable due to the controlled and planned interaction of the individual components. Any level simpler than that of the whole CPSoS cannot comprise the analysis of this type, which makes it challenging to detect or predict emerging behaviors from inside the system. To exemplify, consider a freight barge of which a cargo attribute (e.g., a smart pallet) is not able to comprehend the barge's emergence. \u2022 Type II: weak emergence comprises systems with top-down feedback, imposing constraints on the local interactions. This type of emergence is in principle identifiable, but the interaction complexity can be prohibitive for extant analysis techniques. Consider interacting systems with a (co-)dependency (e.g., a scarce resource) resulting into cumulative, sometimes predictable, propagation across the whole CPSoS. The formation of traffic jams is an example. \u2022 Type III: multiple emergence is characterized by multiple positive (expansion impossible) and negative feedback (contraction impossible) loops in complex systems. New systems can appear while old ones disappear. The behavior (of CSs or of their environment) is non-deterministic and can be chaotic. An example includes truck platooning or the bullwhip effect. \u2022 Type IV: strong emergence comprises completely new properties that cannot be predicted, even in principle, to cumulative system effects. The macro-level properties are irreducible to elementary parts and their interactions", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "use agent-based modeling techniques to support their work.Figure 2.
