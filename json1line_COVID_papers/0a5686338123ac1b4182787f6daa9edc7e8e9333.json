SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus and is similar to those that were the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 (Abrah\u00e3o et al., 2020; Fani et al., 2020) .

Up to now, most patients with this disease have shown mild symptoms, but in some cases, severe symptoms such as respiratory failure, pneumonia, multiple organ dysfunction, and septic shock have been observed (Dargahi et al., 2021b; Organization, 2020) . There are several ways for transmitting the coronavirus to humans, and one of these ways can be the contact with infected surfaces. According to Kampf et al., inanimate surface contact is considered an imperative approach for transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof (Kampf et al., 2020) . The survival time of SARS-CoV-2 on different surfaces (from hours to days), such as metals, glass, and plastic at room temperature can increase the opportunity for transmission via touch (Hu et al., 2020; Kampf et al., 2020) . Moreover, based on the results of Eslami and Jalili, a reduction in the frequency of touching surfaces by hands and disinfecting surfaces will be associated with a decrease in the rate of transmission due to the reduction in the amount of coronavirus load on surfaces (Eslami and Jalili, 2020) . Although an indirect transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 is the transmission from contaminated surfaces and fomites, detecting the virus on the surfaces is basically strange. In the latest reports of the world health organization (WHO), the survival time of this virus is different at different surfaces and the highest survival time is related to a steel surface (Jiang et al., 2020) . One of the places, which can transmit coronavirus through surfaces and inhalation, is fuel stations. Fuel stations have been a major concern for people and health experts from the beginning due to the frequent use of common facilities, because the contact of the hand of a person infected with the coronavirus with the fuel nozzle, gas tank door, ATM, etc., facilitates the possibility of others to be infected with the coronavirus. Fuel supply stations are one of the centers of transmission and spread of coronavirus due to high traffic and frequent visits, so these places are one of the most dangerous chains of coronavirus transmission. However, close gatherings at some fuel stations cannot be ignored, and this may also lead to the transmission of coronavirus by respiration. Therefore, this study was performed to identify the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the nozzles of fuel supply stations in Ardabil province. Ardabil is one of the cities affected by the Coronavirus outbreak. Ardabil city has located in the northwest of Iran as the capital of Ardabil province. Its population is about 625,000 people.

It should be noted that in different cities of Ardabil province (Iran) in December (for one month), due to high mortality and existence of alert condition (Red condition) in most cities of Ardabil province in terms of Covid-19 disease and to prevent people from becoming infected with this disease, corona J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof restrictions (i.e., quarantine of people at home, no traffic at night, the prohibition of entering nonlocal cars to Ardabil, disinfection of all sections of gas stations) were applied and therefore, sampling of the nozzle surfaces of the fuel supply station was performed in two different conditions (before coronavirus restriction and after coronavirus restriction). The results showed that out of nine fuel supply stations (36 samples of nozzle surfaces) that were sampled to identify SARS-CoV-2 in the conditions before the coronavirus restriction, five fuel supply stations were positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on the nozzle surfaces (Table 2 ).

Due to its general use in the city, gas stations are one of the most high-risk places for the spread of the coronavirus. Due to the use of common nozzles, this virus can be easily transmitted from person to person through indirect contact. It is important to note that all samples were positive before quarantine and all samples were negative after quarantine restrictions, which is indicative of the effect of quarantine on controlling the virus in places that require public use. Therefore, it is necessary to focus more on public places such as gas stations. One of the ways to reduce the infection is the control of commonly used surfaces such as gas stations. The use of safe disinfectants such as 70% ethanol and dilute solutions of calcium hypochlorite is recommended for disinfection. This should be done periodically. During the use of gas station nozzles, the gloves should be used. It is recommended that the individuals working in gas stations themselves observe hygiene principles. Using masks and gloves during refueling seems necessary. Due to the effect of quarantine on the control of environmental surface contamination with the virus, it can one of the most effective controlling methods.

SARS-CoV-2 can survive for numerous days on hard surfaces like plastic or stainless steel. In any case, no logical project has examined how numerous individuals get infected by the infection through touching the surfaces compared to coordinate contact with beads spread by respiratory secretions. Correspondence letter in New England Journal of Medicine study unrestricted March 17(Van Doremalen et al., 2020) suggested the virus' natural life on different environment surfaces; the study found that the virus is recognizable on plastic -most gas pump handles are made offor up to 72 hours. It is the fact that surface contact is one of the ways for transmission of the novel coronavirus, and since gas pumps are objects that are ordinarily taken care of by numerous diverse individuals all through the course of a day in numerous places without being routinely cleaned between employments (particularly in zones where self-service is the standard), they are a potential way for the infection to spread from person to person. For numerous people, the intermittent trip to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the gas station is unavoidable, as is touching the pump handle and installment keypad. Pump handles and credit card keypads, which are high-touch ranges, may indicate the infection, which specialists say can remain lively for hours or indeed days on difficult surfaces.In spite of the fact that gas stations can be one of the foremost inclined places for the transmission and spread of coronavirus due to the nearness and visit of individuals, but through the observance of health behaviors and implementing some procedures, cutting the transmission chain in gas stations can be facilitated. Rajiv Suman et al. have appeared survivance of Coronavirus on diverse Surfaces, agreeing to their finding(Suman et al., 2020).Coronavirus can remain for a long time on different surfaces, which may be a major reason for its transmission. This virus can unclean on distinctive metal surfaces and remain on them for long time (from hours to days), with the greatest span on plastic and stainless and slightest on the copper surface. The alcohol-based disinfectants can essentially diminish the survival and time of the infection. The SARS-CoV-2 has critical survival time on distinctive metal surfaces, and their behavior is nearly comparative on different metal surfaces and in the air indoor and outdoor(Suman et al., 2020). In the present study, 25 fuel supply stations were examined to identify covid-19 virus on the surfaces of the nozzles, and the results were presented inTables 2-5. Among these samples, 5 out of 100 samples were positive for SARS -CoV-2. The samples were taken from southern cities of Ardabil province, where the important transportation routes to the capital and other most important cities were located in the south and were not subject to quarantine restrictions for a long time. But the rest of the samples were taken in a situation where all the transport lines were completely quarantined. According to Table 4, the temperature and relative humidity at the time of sampling in different gas stations were 6.0-17.0 \u00b0C and 30.0-61.0 %, respectively. Shi-Yan Ren et al. have shown that SARS-CoV-2 can be maintained in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f unventilated locked buses for at slightest 30 min without losing infectivity. The foremost common coronaviruses may possibly survive or endure on surfaces for up to one month. Infections in respiratory or fecal samples can keep up infectivity for a very long time at room temperature. Retentive materials like cotton are safer than unabsorbent materials for assurance from infection disease. The importance of transmission by means of touching unclean paper is rare (Van Doremalen et al., 2020). Shane Riddell et al. obtained half-lives of between 1.7 and 2.7days at 20 \u00b0C, which was diminished to some hours when the temperature was raised to 40 \u00b0C.With starting viral loads broadly comparable to the most noteworthy titers excreted by irresistible patients, the practical infection was separated from common surfaces such as glass, stainless steel, and both paper and polymer banknotes for up to 28 days at 20 \u00b0C. On the other hand, irresistible infection survived on a few surfaces less than 24 h at 40 \u00b0C(Riddell et al., 2020).Kampf et al., by the investigation of 22 studies, discloses that human coronaviruses such as (SARS), (MERS) coronavirus or common human coronaviruses (HCoV) can keep on lifeless surfaces like glass or plastic and metal, for up to 9 days, but can be competently deactivated by surface disinfection measures with 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, 62-71% ethanol, or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute(Kampf et al., 2020). According to the results of logistic regression, the occurrence of virus infection in the stations was examined according to different variables, and the results showed that the use of personal protective equipment by the staff was not significantly associated with virus infection (OR = 1.03, CI; 0.46 to 3.36, p = 0.791). Also, according to the results, the use of personal protective equipment by drivers, refueling by station personnel, use of disinfectants after refueling, vehicle traffic at the time of refueling had no significant relationship with coronavirus infection at the stations. According to the results, with increasing humidity, the chance of virus infection in stations increases, but this effect is not", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": ", Jiang MD, Xu PP, Chen W, Ni QQ, Lu GM, et al.
