Right ventricle fractional area change (FAC) was measured at 25%, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) 10 mm, right ventricular outflow tract velocity time integral (RVOT VTI) 4.9 cm (Figure 2, Video 1, Table 1), right atrial volume index was 41 ml/m 2 , mild tricuspid regurgitation (Video 2) and he had a normal left ventricular function with ejection fraction (EF) of 69%. The diagnosis of right ventricular failure was made, and the configuration was switched from VV-ECMO to VAV-ECMO (Figure 3). In the following 3 days, the patient showed progressive decrease in hs-Troponin I and NT-NT pro-BNP. A second transesophageal echocardiogram was performed showing normal size of right cavities and normal RV function. FAC was now measured at 52%, TAPSE 22 mm, RVOT VTI 23 cm (Figure 4, Video 3, Table 1), without tricuspid regurgitation, right atrial volume index was 28 ml/m 2 and left ventricular EF was normal at 71%. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure decreased (PASP) from 50 to 30 mmHg and the tricuspid regurgitation disappeared without observation of any intrinsic abnormalities in the tricuspid valvular apparatus and secondary to pressure overload. Consequently, the medical team decided to change to VV-ECMO configuration after 72 hours of starting treatment. Tracheostomy was performed on Day 14, replacement of the oxygenator was performed on Day 21 and ECMO weaning was started on Day 30, once the lungs showed signs of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f improving compliance and better gas exchange. VV-ECMO was withdrawn on day 75. Mechanical ventilation was weaned 6 days after ECMO removal and was discharged from the hospital 10 days later. DISCUSSION For patients who require ECMO assistance, configurations are classified according to the vessels that the blood is withdrawn from or returned to the body. VA-ECMO draws blood from a central vein and reinfuses it back into a major artery. It is used primarily in patients with right or left-sided heart failure as a bridge to recovery, other ventricular assist devices or heart transplantation. VV-ECMO draws blood from a central vein and infuses it back into another central venous location. It is employed in severe respiratory failure as a bridge to recovery and to lung transplantation 3 . VAV-ECMO allows a combination of support from VA and VV-ECMO. VAV-ECMO draws blood from a central vein, and reinfuses it back into a different central vein in addition to a major artery. VAV-ECMO provides hemodynamic and respiratory support at the same time. The WHO guidelines for management of COVID-19 recommend the use of VV-ECMO in eligible patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS 1 . VV-ECMO is usually employed in severe respiratory failure, demonstrating satisfactory results in bridging to recovery and or to lung transplantation. However, in patients with COVID-19 the association of ARDS and RV failure is highly prevalent; hence in this scenario, it is feasible to switch strategy to VAV-ECMO 3 . St\u00f6hr et al suggest that VAV-ECMO conferred benefit in comparison with VV-ECMO in patients with ARDS 4 .", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "The flow in both cannulas depend on cannula diameters and are balanced by using anadjustable clamp and monitored by a flow sensor. The demand for arterialized blood flow on each return cannula varies from patient to patient and over time. In this case the divided return flow was controlled by partially clamping the return cannula. The arterial J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f return flow was maintained at about 30-40% of the cardiac output, and the venous return flow was maintained at about 60-70% of the cardiac output 9 .", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "described in patients with severe respiratory failure connected to VA-ECMO and consists of hypoxemia in the upper body with normal oxygen saturation in the lower body (\"the patient\u00b4s head appears blue, whereas the lower extremities appear pink\") 10 . Typical VA-ECMO flow rate can result in desaturated blood from the left ventricle perfusing the aortic arch and fully saturated infusion blood perfusing the lower body, secondary to high afterload (physiological obstruction) with normal or recovered left ventricular systolic function. According to the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) registry, the modality support in COVID-19 has been VV-ECMO (94%), VA-ECMO (4%) 11 and VAV-ECMO (0.9%); which correlates with the presence of ARDS in COVID-19. CONCLUSION Early detection and treatment of RV dysfunction may lead to decrease mortality and improve patient outcomes in COVID-19. VAV-ECMO appears to be a viable mode of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f treatment for patients with COVID-19 with ARDS and RV failure. Echocardiography plays an important role in early diagnosis and treatment in these patients.
