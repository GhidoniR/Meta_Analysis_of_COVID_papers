With a diameter of 2-3 \u00b5m, platelets have always been considered the main actors in the maintenance of hemostasis, wound healing, pathological development of thrombosis, and recently in the tissue repair processes. These processes are initiated by the activation of different platelet membrane receptors such as glycoproteins Ib (GPiB) and VI (GPVI). However, the platelet external plasma membrane presents a great number of receptors that trigger a network of intracellular signals that allow them to perform many other functions [19] . One of the most overlooked processes is its role in infections, and more specifically in viral infections, as was firstly shown by Terada et al. [20] , who demonstrated the interaction of the influenza virus with platelets, working as carriers of the virus in the bloodstream. Since then, the number of scientific works has increased, confirming the key role of platelets in the first response against viral infections and their connection with the immune system [21] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 689, "end": 693, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 841, "end": 845, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1159, "end": 1163, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Role of Platelets against Viral Infections and SARS-CoV-2"}, {"text": "The activation of platelet response is triggered by the interaction of the virus with the platelet, which is mediated by structures present in platelets and megakaryocytes called Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs). These receptors recognize molecular signals derived from both external pathogens (pathogen-associated molecular patterns, PAMPs) and products of tissue destruction (damage-associated molecular patterns, DAMPs). A large number of PRR types are grouped into recipient families such as Toll-like receptors (TLR), C-type lectin receptors (CLR), Dendritic Cell-Specific ICAM3-Grabbing Non-Integrin (DC-SIGN), complement receptors, or chemokine receptors [22] . It should be noted that although platelets are not nucleated cells, megakaryocytes provide them during their formation with both the genetic and molecular material needed to synthesize proteins, which can also be translated from RNA viruses [23] . In the case of the binding between SARS-CoV-2 and platelets, the results to date are contradictory. Manne et al. did not detect Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors mRNA or protein neither in platelets nor in megakaryocytes of COVID-19 patients, suggesting that the virus uptake in platelets happens by alternative mechanisms [24] . However, other studies did demonstrate the presence of ACE-2 receptors on platelets, as well as the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 that primes SARS-CoV-2 for cell entry [25, 26] . In addition, Zhang et al. observed the internalization and degradation of the ACE-2 receptor after interaction with the virus.

Concerning direct responses, platelets are able to phagocytize viral elements through endosomal and lysosomal mechanisms, resulting in the transport of pathogens and the clearance of the virus [28] . After binding the viral pathogens, the platelets can also be activated, leading to the degranulation and release of the contents stored in different granules called dense granules, \u03b1-granules, and lysosomes. Among the multitude of substances released, microbicide molecules such as peptides and cytokines are present, which confer antiviral activity to the platelets, helping inactivate and eliminate the virus [29] . This platelet degranulation and consequent release of molecules also generate an indirect response against infection, involving cells of the immune system [30] [31] [32] [33] . (1), different responses are triggered. Viral pathogens can be phagocytized by platelets (2) , which are also activated producing a degranulation and release of different biomolecules (3). While some biomolecules have microbiocidal properties, others activate the cells of the immune system (4). All these actions cause both the elimination of the virus (5) and the destruction of platelets, causing a thrombocytopenia (6) . This thrombocytopenia is also influenced by the decrease in the production of platelets by the megakaryocytes after their interaction with the virus (7). In addition, the activation of immune system cells such as neutrophils generates structures and aggregates such as Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) that help eliminate pathogens (8) .

Middleton et al. found that viral infections altered the expression of numerous transcripts in human and murine platelets, upregulating the expression of the integrin alpha-II\u03b2 (ITGA2B) that is associated with increased mortality [16] .

The presence of cytokines and chemokines such as CD40L, Interleukin 1-\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), or platelet factor 4 (CXCL4) generate inflammation processes that affect endothelial cells, activation of the complement system, and recruitment of leukocytes in the attempt to eliminate pathogens [34] [35] [36] [37] . Platelet alteration and hyperreactivity caused by virus interaction could lead to the dysregulated formation of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) or NETosis. The interaction between platelets, pathogens, and neutrophils originate these structures consisting of DNA, decondensed chromatin, histones, and granule proteins. NETs are part of the innate immune system whose function is the trapping and elimination of pathogens, and they are involved in the inflammatory processes [15] . In infectious processes such as those caused by viruses, NETosis may be dysregulated and increased, leading to vascular and respiratory problems such as ARDS [38] . A recent study with COVID-19 patients found a strong correlation between the increased NETs formation and the augmented severity of the disease [39] and, along with other works, highlights the involvement of this dysregulated NETosis with ARDS and coagulopathy associated with COVID-19 [40, 41] . In addition, more studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 induces the excessive formation of leukocyteplatelet aggregates, being present especially in COVID-19 patients who presented the most severe symptomatology [42] .

This stabilization is produced thanks to factors released by the platelets such as sphingosine-1 that act on the endothelial cells, preserving this barrier [43] . In situations of inflammation and hyperreactivity of platelets generated in COVID-19, the disruption of this barrier occurs [15, 44] , allowing the passage of fluid and structures such as platelet aggregates and leukocyte-platelet aggregates to the alveolar space. As a result, edemas are produced, giving rise to the ARDS symptomatology [45] . Moreover, the destabilization of this barrier and the ultimate cause of ARDS also occurs in situations of thrombocytopenia that are present in this type of infection, creating a vicious circle [15] . Lippi et al. found a decrease in platelet count in COVID-19 patients that also resulted in a risk marker for increased mortality [46] . On the one hand, this thrombocytopenia is due to the elimination of the virus through platelet phagocytosis, which leads to platelet destruction. On the other hand, the degranulation of platelets in order to release their molecular content also contributes to thrombocytopenia. This reduction in platelet number is increased by the action of megakaryocytes that respond to the presence of viruses releasing interferon that causes a decline in platelet synthesis [42, 47] . Finally, we must take into consideration the importance of the lung in the formation of platelets. While the classical idea stated that platelets were originated from megakaryocytes in the bone marrow and also into the bloodstream, this concept has evolved. Several works confirmed that megakaryocytes were capable of passing into the bloodstream and were trapped in the lungs, becoming important niches where these cells are accumulated and where they also carried out the release of platelets. This entrapment in the lungs is not only due to mechanical processes because of the size of megakaryocytes compared to the pulmonary blood vessels but also due to molecular processes of adhesion with the endothelium [48, 49] . Thus, the affectation of the lungs would mean a decrease in the thrombopoiesis, which added to the processes of thrombocytopenia mentioned above, would aggravate the destabilization of the alveolocapillary barrier.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 381, "end": 385, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 512, "end": 516, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 517, "end": 520, "text": "44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 726, "end": 730, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 926, "end": 930, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1062, "end": 1066, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1531, "end": 1535, "text": "[42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1536, "end": 1539, "text": "47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2254, "end": 2258, "text": "[48,", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2259, "end": 2262, "text": "49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Importance of Platelets in Lung Biology"}, {"text": "After the inflammation processes, destabilization of the alveolocapillary barrier and the consequent accumulation of the increased interstitial and intra-alveolar fluid and appearance of the ARDS, which compromises the gaseous exchange and the life of the patient, a reparative phase begins trying to repair the damaged tissue and restore the homeostasis. This phase is characterized by an expansion of resident fibroblasts and the formation of a provisional matrix as well as the proliferation of airway progenitor cells and type II alveolar epithelial cells, with differentiation into type I alveolar epithelial cells. Once epithelial integrity is reestablished, the resorption of alveolar edema and the temporary matrix restore the alveolar architecture and function. However, persistent damage due to inflammatory processes in the ARDS and failure of tissue repair lead to the development of interstitial changes and fibrosis. In this process, there is an accumulation of cell populations such as fibroblasts and macrophages as well as excess extracellular material, namely collagen and fibronectin. In addition, this excessive fibrosis is difficult to resolve due to the imbalance generated between antifibrotic and profibrotic factors [50] .

Part of these treatments should be focused on the platelet response due to its importance in the defense against the virus and the lung biology, which are therapies not only effective against COVID-19 but also against other conditions that share this physiopathology and symptomatology. Among the treatments to be applied in these situations, those based on regenerative medicine should be taken into consideration due to their capacity to modulate inflammatory, immune, and reparative processes. Studies on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which can come from different sources such as bone marrow, adipose tissue, or umbilical cord, showed their potential therapeutic effects on lung conditions caused by viral infections. Although many of its mechanisms remain unknown, researchers have highlighted the importance of the activation of MSCs through receptors such as TLRs, triggering a paracrine action through the release of several molecules: angiopoietin-1 and keratinocyte growth factor that favor the restoration of the alveolocapillary barrier in ARDS, chemokines such as the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) that attract and activate leukocyte cells, exosomes, and anti-inflammatory molecules [51] . The first COVID-19 clinical trials with this therapy are offering promising results. The patients of these trials received human umbilical cord MSCs and bone marrow stem cell-derived exosomes by the intravenous route.

In the last 20 years, its use has been extended to different pathologies of the locomotor system with very encouraging results in numerous pathologies, both acute and chronic.

PRP has already demonstrated its efficacy in the local treatment of degenerative conditions such as joint degeneration of the knee or hip [14] . It is also being applied in different pathologies in other branches of medicine such as ophthalmology, dermatology, nervous system lesions, and recently in gynecology as a treatment for ovarian and uterine pathology, for example.

First, the administration of PRP by air would reach the lungs directly. The mode of application in other medicine fields is by local infiltration. In the case of lung pathology, we can only reach the broncho-alveolar tree by local instillation or nebulization. Instillation would provoke coughing in COVID-19 patients with a high risk of contagion by aerosolization. Therefore, the only way to deliver PRP into the alveoli would be nebulization. Second, autologous PRP could not be used due to the viral alteration of platelets, the significant increase in inflammatory cytokines present in plasma, and the thrombocytopenia associated with these pathologies. The application of the PRP effector molecules directly in the lung could favor an anti-inflammatory action through (1) molecules such as IGF-1 and HGF, which act on intracellular pathways [59] , (2) the favoring of the reparative macrophages M2 phenotype [55] , and (3) the action on oxidative stress [56] . Moreover, this modulation of the inflammation, which is key in the physiopathology of these infections, would be accompanied by an antiviral effect and by a tissue repair stimulation, allowing us to reestablish pulmonary structures as the alveolocapillary barrier. In fact, both in vitro and in vivo models have demonstrated the usefulness of PRP for the maintenance of the endothelial barrier, including the reversal of permeability in the lungs due to thrombocytopenia [60, 61] . The different biomolecules present in platelet lysate modulate cellular activity, promoting tissue repair [57, 62] , which may also be favored by the reparative action of Alveolar Type II Cells, as they may mimic mesenchymal stem cells [63] , and which, resembling these, could be stimulated by platelet molecules [64] . All these processes are based on the balanced action of the biomolecule cocktail present in the platelet lysate, which stimulate and inhibit different cellular response and interact with each other, complicating the cause-effect relationship ( Table 2 ). The mechanism of action of biomolecules present in platelet lysate is based on their interaction with cell receptors, which triggers the different cellular signals that determine cell behavior. The resulting cellular response is both autocrine and paracrine, causing an effect not only on the cells stimulated by the platelet lysate but also on adjacent cells. This generates a global response throughout the tissue, making neither a direct intracellular action nor a complete diffusion of the platelet lysate in all tissue cells necessary [14, 65] . Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that, as occurs in other tissues, the direct arrival of the nebulized platelet lysate molecules by the airway on lung cells will unleash a series of processes that affect the entire tissue, generating a biological environment favorable for healing. Relieving these processes of inflammatory reaction and tissue destruction also could lead to a modulated and less aggressive repair process, which, in addition to anti-fibrotic factors [58, 66] , could decrease or prevent pulmonary fibrosis. This prevention of fibrosis was already observed clinically in other tissues due to the reduction of inflammation and the repaired processes promoted by the PRP [67, 68] . The cellular response observed in this work suggests that PRP nebulization does not affect the proliferation of lung fibroblasts, which would be involved in the repair processes. Cell migration and proliferation, and tissue repair [57, 62] VEGF-A/TGF-\u03b21 Fibroblast Antifibrotic effect [58, 66] The present work shows that PRP nebulization does not entail a detriment of its composition or its bioactivity on cell cultures, in terms of cellular proliferation. However, it can cause a minor water evaporation throughout the nebulization process, and this could explain the slightly higher growth factors and cytokine levels in the nebulized PL in comparison with the standard one. This difference was statistically significant in the case of PDGF, which was mainly due to the low standard deviation present between its replicates. In the proposed protocol, the PRP is not nebulized but the content is released after its activation or platelet lyase, which contains the effector biomolecules of plasma and platelets. In this way, subjecting the platelets to a process that could alter them is avoided, nebulizing only their content that does not seem to be degraded according to the data obtained. By nebulizing just the platelet lysate, the administration of proteins involved in the coagulation process is also avoided, preventing their possible action on the target tissues.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 990, "end": 994, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1057, "end": 1061, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1103, "end": 1107, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1581, "end": 1585, "text": "[60,", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1586, "end": 1589, "text": "61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1698, "end": 1702, "text": "[57,", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1703, "end": 1706, "text": "62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1828, "end": 1832, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1906, "end": 1910, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 2708, "end": 2712, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2713, "end": 2716, "text": "65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 3191, "end": 3195, "text": "[58,", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 3196, "end": 3199, "text": "66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 3409, "end": 3413, "text": "[67,", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 3414, "end": 3417, "text": "68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 3651, "end": 3655, "text": "[57,", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 3656, "end": 3659, "text": "62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 3705, "end": 3709, "text": "[58,", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 3710, "end": 3713, "text": "66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2157, "end": 2164, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Therapeutic Potential of Platelet-Rich Plasma against COVID-19"}, {"text": "These results are preliminary, and further studies in additional relevant cell lines confirming the efficacy and safety of the nebulized platelet lysates could be useful. However, there are several preclinical and clinical studies that have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of administering PRP directly into the lungs (Table 3 ). In an in vitro study over airway epithelial cells subjected to pro-inflammatory stimuli, an increased viability of these cells was observed after the addition of HGF, which is one of the main active components of the PRP [69] . Mamoto et al. conducted in vivo studies evaluating the action of platelet lysate on lung tissue. In one of those studies, they demonstrated alveolar regeneration and stimulation of pulmonary vascularization after the application of platelet lysate in mice submitted to a pneumonectomy [70] . In other work of the same authors, they demonstrated that platelet lysate regulated the prevention of LPS-induced vascular leakage in the lungs of mice by suggesting a possible therapeutic approach for sepsis-induced ARDS as well as other diseases caused by abnormal vascular permeability [71] . Bronchial administration of PRP by instillation also proved to be a promising treatment in inflammatory pathologies. Dzyekanski et al. observed in an equine model of respiratory disease a significant improvement in clinical and cytological parameters seven days after its administration. These horses did not present cough, and their degree of tracheal mucus was significantly reduced as well as the relative neutrophil count. The authors concluded that PRP proved to be beneficial for lung inflammation and did not present biosecurity problems [72] . In addition to preclinical studies, a clinical study was conducted on burnt patients with airway disease [73] . This prospective study included 40 patients with 25-50% burns and inhalation lung injury. They were divided into two groups of 20 patients. The experimental group received aerosolized PRP particles in addition to the regular treatment. Biological improvements were observed in the upper airways of the PRP-treated patients compared to the control group. The mean extubation time was 7 \u00b1 1 days in the PRP group compared to 14 \u00b1 1 days in the control group, and it had a shorter hospital stay as well as a lower mortality rate. The authors concluded that the application of the nebulized PRP solution could be a beneficial therapeutic tool for the regeneration of the damaged pulmonary tree after the burn. Furthermore, the biosafety of the treatment was demonstrated. All these in vitro and in vivo studies reported no adverse effects. It is reasonable to expect that similar to any other drug, PRP could be toxic at high concentrations of its active ingredient, in this case platelets.

A fraction of this platelet lysate is transferred to a new tube, and the rest of the volume is nebulized and retrieved in a new tube. Then, both formulations, the standard and the nebulized ones, are assayed to characterize their growth factor and cytokine content and to evaluate their bioactivity potential on lung culture proliferation in vitro.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 562, "end": 570, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)"}, {"text": "In order to determine whether the nebulization process affects PRP content, the growth factor levels of standard and nebulized platelet lysates of four donors were measured by ELISA kits (Bio-techne; Minneapolis, MN, USA) in duplicate.
