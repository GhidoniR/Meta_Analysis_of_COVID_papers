A total of 1,200 patients (9.5%) had out of hospital cardiac arrest, 369 patients had stable condition and 831 patients had cardiogenic shock at the PCI hospital. 699 patients had cardiogenic shock without out of hospital cardiac arrest.

For contact to balloon time ranging from 60 to 180 min, they found a nearly linear relationship between treatment time and mortality in all the groups. Every 10-min treatment delay resulted in 3.31 additional deaths in 100 PCI treated cardiogenic shock patients with no out of hospital cardiac arrest. The most recent European Society of Cardiology Guidelines recommend the maximum expected delay between FMC and primary PCI should be considered as the essential time target for clinical decision and the quality metric for care delivery, and not just the in-hospital D2BT.
