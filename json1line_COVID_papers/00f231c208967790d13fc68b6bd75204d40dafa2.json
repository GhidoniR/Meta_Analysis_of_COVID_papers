Figure 1 places the ''classic 3'' scientific conference content types-presentations, posters, and conference abstracts-on a continuum ranging from ''easy to produce'' to ''hard to produce'' and from ''small impact'' (on just a few people) to ''big impact'' (reaching tens or hundreds of thousands of people).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 383, "end": 391, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "As shown in Figure 1 , presentations and posters take a great deal of effort to produce but are only seen by a narrow subset of scientists who pay to attend the conference and also manage to make time for that particular session.

Posting Talks behind a Paywall Is Better than Nothing Having all our talks recorded and posted behind a paywall (or login wall) on a conference organization's website (as many conferences are doing now during the pandemic) is a huge step toward broader impact because it helps our talks reach those scientists who attended the conference but missed the talk and those who could not afford the time or money to travel to the conference. But the audience is still limited to members who both pay dues and tolerate the often-clunky conference website. Sporadic Uploading to Websites like YouTube and Youku Could Start a Trend toward Higher Impact The impact potential of scientific talks cannot be fully realized until they are posted on major, public video sharing sites like YouTube because that's where the people are (scientists and otherwise). Sites like YouTube (in the United States) and Youku (in China) each receive over one billion views per day (SimilarWeb, 2020) . Encouraging scientists to upload their talks to public video sharing sites individually would create sprinklings of high impact, but adoption would likely be patchy given that scientists lack experience and comfort with the process and may be unmotivated to try it because they are inexperienced with how rewarding broad impact can be. Mass Uploading to Public Video Sharing Websites Would Change Science and the World To ensure that nearly all scientific conference talks are published to popular sites like YouTube and Youku-and give many scientists exposure to the sublime feeling of having a broad impact-we could stop waiting on scientists to do it themselves.
