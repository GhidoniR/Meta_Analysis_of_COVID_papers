According to the \"Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (Provisional 7th Edition)\", the pathological characteristic of COVID-19 infector is a reduction in the number and function of immune cells such as CD4 + CD8 + T cells in lymphoid tissue [9] . Current research shows that it could improve both cellular and humoral immunity in the long-term practice of TCE. On the one hand, TCE can increase the CD4+/CD8+ ratio to strengthen cellular immunity by decreasing the number of CD8 + T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. To a certain extent, it has the potential to promote immune regulation [10] and immune surveillance [11] by improving NK cell activity. On the other hand, TCE has been reported to increase immunoglobulin levels (either IgM, or IgG, or IgA) and enhance B lymphocytes function to directly strengthen humoral autoimmunity [12, 13] .

Firstly, the majority of COVID-19 patients presented with respiratory symptoms, including high fever and coughing, and abnormal indicators of pulmonary functions. TCE has a positive effect on improving respiratory symptoms, such as coughing, fever and sweating, throat swellings and phlegm [14] . It also has resulted in improvements in ventilatory efficiency by increasing BODE Index, FEV1/FVC ratio and 6-min walking test (6MWT)of COPD patient [15] , and decrease in the measures of Peak Expiratory Flow Rates(PEFR) and Maximal voluntary ventilation(MVV) [16] . Secondly, different degrees of myocardial damage symptoms occur in the part of COVID-19 patients [17] . TCE could increase the compensatory force of the heart pump and myocardial contractility and improve cardiac function [18] . In addition, it can simultaneously decrease the B-type natriuretic peptide(BNP) level and regulate amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide(NT-proBNP) level of heart failure patient for improving circulation [19] . At present, TCE could be used as adjunctive therapy for hypoxemia treatment by improving saturated oxygen in arterial blood(SpO2).

Long-term practice of TCE serves to be conducive to the liver and renal function recovery which is manifested with decrease serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase(ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and improve 24-h urinary protein in patients with chronic kidney disease [25, 26] . Moreover, TCE could be used as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of underlying disease by regulating blood pressure, lipid and glucose, such as the reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure of hypertensive individuals, the adjustment in total serum cholesterol level and improvement fasting blood glucose of type 2 diabetes individuals [27] [28] [29] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 463, "end": 467, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 619, "end": 623, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 730, "end": 734, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 834, "end": 838, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 959, "end": 963, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1178, "end": 1182, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1316, "end": 1320, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1321, "end": 1324, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1569, "end": 1573, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1804, "end": 1808, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1809, "end": 1812, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2173, "end": 2177, "text": "[25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2178, "end": 2181, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2536, "end": 2540, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2541, "end": 2545, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2546, "end": 2550, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Improving viscera function to play various accessory roles in the treatment of COVID-19"}, {"text": "During the course of COVID-19 rehabilitation, TCE can play a role in promoting the absorption of lung lesions, relieving residual symptoms and improving emotion and the quality of life. Firstly, some of the COVID-19 patients remain lung lesions of varying degrees and symptoms of respiratory and gastrointestinal systems after hospital discharge due to poor organ functional recovery. Under the guidance of TCM theory, TCE could reconcile Qi and blood, smooth the meridians and regulate the functions of internal organs by nourishing the Qi originated from Dantian which locates on the lower abdomen, on the anterior midline, a distance of four fingers below the umbilicus [30] . It may also promote the formation of internal Zongqi which can enhance lung function and metabolism [30] . With respect to organ rehabilitation, TCE can promote lung recovery of patients [31, 32] as well as improve diaphragm exercise capacity [33] . TCE can also ameliorate gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting by regulating the state of intestinal flora and increasing counts of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli [34] . Secondly, COVID-19 patients may suffer different levels of depression and anxiety symptoms, which significantly reduced their physical quality of life. The clinical trials show that TCE can relieve the negative emotions, such as anxiety, depression, anger and tension, and improve Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scores [35] [36] [37] [38] . TCE can significantly improve the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index(PSQI)and physical discomfort with fatigue and pain, which is also conducive to improving the patients' quality of sleep and life [39] .
