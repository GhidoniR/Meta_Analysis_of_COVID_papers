The social policy in India too has followed the dichotomy of organised and unorganised sector by developing a dual system of social security-a comprehensive, portable social security for organised sector employees who usually have regular salaried jobs and a minimalist social security for unorganised sector workers who are the most vulnerable groups-socially as well as economically. Building upon the ILO Social Protection Floor recommendation, the paper argues for reimagining social security as an intervention to make drastic improvements in the living standard of the entire workforce of India. It highlights three weaknesses in the existing social security system-one, they are based on a reductionist package of social insurance and social assistance; two, they lack a threshold push to make a real change in the lives of beneficiaries and three, the prevailing policy environment seeks to keep workers in abominable conditions in the name of expanding employment opportunities. However, both high as well as some low-income countries have shown that social security can be successfully used to uplift the living standard of vast majority of masses. Rather than treating growth and social security as binaries, a developing country like India, the paper argues, needs to make departure from the growth objectives it has hitherto followed and invest massively into people's lives. To overcome the historic weaknesses of social security programmes in India, the gap between formal and informal sector must be minimised. The paper strongly argues for making Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and Employees State Insurance (ESI)-the two flagship programmes designed for the organised sector-universal social security programmes in India.

For migrants, all social security programmes and schemes must have an inbuilt portability clause. This would require investing into technology platforms, overcoming exclusions created by the requirements of domicile, adhering to the principle of non-discrimination and equal citizenship, recognising the contributions made by migrants in the growth and development of the country, and amending the basic design of some crucial funds for inter-state portability of resources so that they finally reach the workers.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "This chapter is being written in a particular background. The novel coronavirus pandemic, known as COVID-19, has caused the severest global health crisis since the Spanish Flu of 1918-1920.

India though like other Asian and African countries has witnessed less virulence of the disease, has lost more than 15,000 lives while more than half a million persons have got infected. Taking cue from experiences of some countries in containing the spread of the virus by breaking the human to human contact chain, India imposed a curfew-like lockdown from 25 March 2020 which was in phases extended up to 31 May 2020. However, the lockdown triggered a massive exodus of intra-state and inter-state migrants from towns and cities, particularly industrial growth centres.

As the lockdown kept extending, the migrants were further gripped with the fear that they would exhaust savings which were precious for their families back home. In several cases, they were forced to seek reverse remittance from their families to meet their daily expenses and to meet the cost of their return. According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, COVID's immediate impact on employment was the loss of over 100 million jobs. 2 These reports and visuals helped bring the plight of migrants at the centre-stage of the pandemic as well as development discourse.

These are not mutually exclusive; instead they bring out different dimensions of social security requirements of both, migrants and nonmigrants. They have a great degree of overlap, except that migrants face restrictions on accessing schemes because of issues related to portability and also face more problems concerning housing than local workers. None of the above is addressed by the Interstate Migrant Workmen Act, 1970. The Act does not apply on informal ways of recruitment which is, in practice, the rule rather than the exception. Moreover, the benefits accruing to the worker under the Act, if all norms are followed, are actually minimal limited to wages, leaves, suitable accommodation, etc. The maximum liability of a registered contractor for a registered Migrant worker during any crisis, such as the present one, would have been to provide return fare to his/her place of residence. Similarly, The Unorganised Workers' Social Security Act, 2008 is a classic example of a highly reductionist approach to social security. It limits its ambit to life and disability, health and maternity, and old age protection and leaves other social security needs up to the state governments. It excludes a large number of informal workers like agricultural workers, construction workers and informal workers in the formal sector, and ignores the working conditions of the informal workers and the particular problems of the women workers (Majumdar and Borbora 2013). It did not give any new benefit to workers instead notified pre-existing 10 schemes in its schedule 3 some of which are rather defunct. The Government of India in 2019 introduced a new bill, called The Code on Social Security, 2019 in the parliament which is under the pre-legislative consultation process. 4 The Bill is almost a reproduction of the 2008 Act and is limited to life and disability cover; health and maternity benefits; and old age protection. 5", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Current Edifice of Social Security"}, {"text": "The social security edifice of India chiefly consists of schemes that can be divided into two categories.

Experiences of several countries have also shown the success of economic growth in improving living standards but those have been the direct result of social intervention rather than of simple economic growth (Dreze and Sen 1991) . We, therefore, argue that a multi-dimensional, inclusive and equityoriented conceptualisation of social security sets a social policy agenda for the state, markets, industry associations, trade unions, civil society organisations and other actors and would require them to re-orient their goals accordingly. 8 From this perspective, existing migration and social security related legislations and schemes in India suffer from three major problems: a) reductionism; b) inadequacy to cross the threshold and c) incoherence. Reductionism limits the choices to a minimalist package in the name of effectiveness, constraints of resources and manageability. A threshold is the level at which something starts to happen or have an effect. When a scheme is designed to be minimalist in terms of scale, it fails to effect a change. If a minimum level of decent living in old age requires x amount, a support which is one-fourth of x amount will not help attain decency instead will only allow living a wretched life in old age. Incoherence arises because of adverse policy climate where the State considers labour protection antithetical to labour market flexibility, perceived as one of the essential conditions for attracting investments.

While the former is concerned with preventing a decline in living standard in general and in the basic conditions of living in particular; the latter is concerned with achieving higher incomes and living standards. In developed countries where living standard is high and the size of poor is relatively small, contingency-based social security system works reasonably well, whereas in India a social security system will have to adopt promotion strategies that can raise living standards. In the following pages, we have tried to present an outline of a social security system for India which is based on four guiding principles: i) narrowing the gap between organised and unorganised sector social security; ii) reducing social insecurities in everyday life in the present by ensuring a minimum decent living standard; iii) creating mechanisms to take care of old age and contingency needs and iv) ensuring delivery of social security in a way that it does not disincentivise spatial mobility.

For example, what wage floor will be used to calculate the contribution of employees and employer/government, given the diversity of occupation, income, payment system, job fluctuations and period of unemployment of unorganised workers? How to ensure that the contribution is not too low to make the threshold impact? Universalising EPF and ESI would also require registration of all workers in the country and providing them with a unique identification number as envisaged in the Unorganised Workers Social Security Act, 2008 and a system of regular updating of their data. Both EPF and ESI would require dismantling restrictions on their subscription such as the size of the enterprise and cap on salary up to Rs. 15,000 per month to include all workers since due to these restrictions the schemes cover less than half of organised sector workers. Though Massive expansion of ESI hospital and domiciliary facilities may be required, the state and central governments will have to agree to gradually bring ESIC facilities 10 According to Banerjee and Duflo, 'Research in psychology has now been applied to a range of economic phenomena to show that we think about the present very differently from the way we think about the future (a notion referred to as \"time inconsistency\")'. 11 Report of the Working Group on Migration (2017: 34), in the context of health security, recommends 'covering contract and even unorganised workers under ESI'. However, there is no further discussion on this in the Report. Duggal (2006) argues for restructuring ESI to accommodate the entire workforce by removing all restrictions for coverage under the Act like wage limits, numbers employed, etc. and general health services under a common governance mechanism so that access to universal primary health care is not compromised. On top of it, bringing social security of organised and unorganised sector workers on the par would require reorienting the economic and social policies towards formalisation of economy. This will clearly be an epoch-making departure from the economic dispensation that has become the hallmark of developing countries' economy. The government should form a Commission to suggest a roadmap to roll out the new social security programme which aims at ensuring up to par benefits for unorganised workers.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1634, "end": 1647, "text": "Duggal (2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Narrowing the Gap Between Organised and Unorganised Sector"}, {"text": "We have successful examples of functioning of some welfare funds at the state level, for example in Kerala, that demonstrate the feasibility of delivering provident fund, gratuity, unemployment relief, social assistance and insurance cover to life, disability and accidents, and several other benefits, similar to those offered by the EPF and ESI, to a range of unorganised workers with diverse occupations and differential earnings and risks associated with each of them (NCEUS 2006) .

Moreover, taking a giant leap towards formalisation would have extraordinary spin-off effects on the economy in the form of massive investments in water, sanitation, housing, and other urban and rural infrastructure, correcting demand-side weaknesses by infusing purchasing power in half a billion workforce, and constant skill upgradation to deal with the problem of redundancy and unemployment. This would also save resources that are spent on treating preventable diseases, and avoid frequent disruptions in work. This will, in the medium to the longer run, substantially reduce the need for state subsidy in social security programmes by improving market wages, work and living conditions and purchasing power of workers. 12 The calculation is based on the assumption that the average earning of 84% of 47 crore workforce is Rs. 10,000 per month, and in their case, the employer contribution will be met by the government. The total premium to be borne by the government will be 183,300 crores. 13 Considering 24% contribution of employer and employees for 84% of 47 crore workforce whose average monthly income is Rs. 10,000 per month, the total contribution will be 11.37 lakh crore.

In rural areas, SCs, STs, Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) and women can take advantage of interest subsidy up to 3% or up to 2 lakh. In urban areas, central assistance of 1-1.5 lakh is available for in situ slum redevelopment with private participation, or construction of a house by those belonging to EWS or for affordable housing by private or public sector builders where they reserve at least 35% houses for EWS. Interest subsidy of different slabs amounting not more than up to 2.67 lakh for different socio-economic groups is available under a credit-linked subsidy scheme. These schemes are primarily meant for EWS which includes unorganised sector workers and migrants. However, urban housing is highly complicated and it is doubtful to what extent the scheme can improve access to minimum decent housing for migrants and other unorganised workers. 6. Employment: Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) is a demand-based rural employment programme under which the government is obliged to provide up to 100 days of employment to a rural household. All MGNREGA workers are unorganised workers and an overwhelming number of them are likely to be circular and seasonal migrants too. 7. Cash Support: Family Benefit Scheme provides onetime cash support to a family who has lost its bread earner. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana provides cash support of Rs. 6,000 in four instalments to all farmers (with certain exclusion criteria). Since a considerable number of unorganised workers and migrants come from very small farmers, they too benefit from the scheme. However, the landless wage earners as well as tenants are outside the purview of the scheme. At present, there is no regular cash support scheme for unorganised workers and migrants. Workers' welfare boards in some sectors have the mandate to provide cash support to its members in specific conditions. 8.
