We could demonstrate a shift of the most frequent symptoms from initially olfactory loss to dyspnoea later on. Dyspnoea then persists over a mean of nearly 70 days in about one third of the patients while olfactory loss was still reported by 4%. We did not find statistically significant or clinically meaningful differences for any of the baseline characteristics in univariate analysis. Female patients showed a trend to being more often symptomatic. Respiratory disorders were numerically slightly more frequent in symptomatic as compared to asymptomatic patients (12% vs. 8%) with bronchial asthma being the leading entity. In previous reports, asthma was not associated with more severe outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infection in general [15, 16] . Although lying within the normal range, we found differences in lung function parameters. The reduction of TLCO can be potentially attributed to structural damage as previously seen during the 2002/2003 pandemic. Likewise, reduction of VC might be an expression of musculoskeletal weakness. Long-term consequences remain unknown. Nevertheless, we believe they may already have clinical relevance. First, these changes were associated with clinical symptoms and may even justify medication. Second, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on small airway function may be larger as previously shown in chronic obstructive lung disease [17] . This can provide a missing link between lung function and clinical presentation requiring further research.

We do not consider these points as major drawbacks of our study since we intentionally aimed at investigating a -5 -rather healthy and young cohort. Severely ill patients are therefore underrepresented in our study with only 9% of the hospitalized population requiring ICU treatment. While severely ill patients intuitively have greater impairments at discharge as recently demonstrated [19] , we believe our findings are valuable in this context.
