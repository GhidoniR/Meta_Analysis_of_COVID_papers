On this assumption one can calculate the difference in this fraction between regions from the observed change in the ratio of the rates of death. This approach results in values of the infection fatality rate of aproximately 1/250, or lower, rather than the 1/100 usually taken to be the case (though I note that the number of deaths reported is potentially subject to upward corrections due to some potential omissions, e.g. in England the figure is taken as deaths in hospital, and inclusion of corrections to this could raise the if r by a factor of up to 50%). When different demographics are taken into account, the results are consistent for Italy, Spain and England. Note, however, that the extracted values of z 1,ef f , z 2,ef f , the fractions of populations in a region no longer susceptible to infection, are insensitive to this potential shortfall in reporting of deaths (assuming it is the same throughout a given country), and are more robust than the inferred values of if r. As shown, the same high values of z ef f could alternatively be obtained by there being a variable susceptibility to infection within the population (or in connectivity [11] ), and if the if r is indeed about 0.01 this could mean that the variance in this susceptibility is about V = 2. Of course, it is also possible that higher than currently expected values of z could be due to some combination of the factors. I note that it is instead possible that this observed difference in the decay rates between regions could be due to those regions with highest initial number of cases observing the rules of social distancing more diligently, as argued in [12] for the case of municipalities within Lombardy. However, it seems this would have to apply to Lombardy, Madrid and London compared to the remainder of Italy, Spain and England in a very consistent manner, with in each case the more affected region needing to have a value of R about 0.2 lower than the rest of the country. From the general trend of the ratio of the rates in the time before the peaks are reached it also appears as though this difference in R would have had to have started well before the so-called \"lockdown\" in each country, since the decrease in the ratio is seen in the rate of deaths as early as a week or so after the \"lockdown\". This lower R in Lombardy, Madrid, and London would be despite the fact that these more affected regions are very largely those which are most densely populated. Hence, in these regions one might naturally expect R to be greater due to greater proximity of population, more use of public transport etc. If it were the case that R is in fact greater in Lombardy, Madrid and London than the remainder of the respective countries, then explaining the behaviour of the ratios would require raising the values of z 1,ef f and z 2,ef f extracted, and consequently lead to smaller if r than the values calculated here.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1792, "end": 1796, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2276, "end": 2280, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "The model I apply is extremely simple and there are numerous sources of uncertainty, which are difficult to quantify. In particular, the value of inferred if r is proportional to \u03c3, which I have taken to be 1/(7 days) (similar to the average value in [10] ) but which could vary by tens of percent. Since the values of 1/z ef f and if r are linearly proportional to \u03c3, a change in \u03c3 translates directly into their values. However, this sensitivity is completely correlated across all quantities and has no influence on the ratios of the if r values from different regions, i.e. their very good agreement is not affected by any changes in \u03c3.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 251, "end": 255, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "The assumption of constant z ef f fractions is also a simplification, though the difference z 1,ef f \u2212 z 2,ef f is less affected by this assumption than each individually, as they vary in the same direction. Also, asumptions about a constant time from infection to death can clearly be improved upon, though, as noted, this is not as important for rather slow variation, which is the case here for the quantitative study for times beyond the peak. It may be the case that the full effect of social distancing had not set in at the start of the time periods considered in each case, which are chosen to be at or very slightly beyond the peak in fatalities. In this case R may effectively be larger at the beginning. Indeed, a transition at the peak is observed in Section 3. This potential variation is checked by varying the start date by 2 days either way, and does indeed lead to the largest uncertainty, which is applied in the quoted results. Other than the value of \u03c3, which is common to all results, this is the dominant uncertainty.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "The type of if r and/or variable susceptibility inferred here would also suggest that New York (in particular) and Belgium (where regional variations are small) should now, during May, be experiencing significant effects from an extra (1\u2212z ef f ) factor multiplying their R value. It seems likely that this is indeed the case from the features of their death rates for this time period, with New York in particular exhibiting a consistently declining number of deaths per day, while in general the remainder of the USA displays a still increasing rate. (In principle, New York and the USA could be examined in detail, and is clearly following a roughly similar trend to the three cases in this article, but the reminder of the USA is so large and with such different conditions and stages of the spread that it is more difficult to assess with confidence.) In fact, for Belgium it is notable that despite instituting social distancing measures only four days after Spain (and at a time when Belgium had a very small number of deaths) and well before England, the peak in the death rate was only reached 10-14 days after Spain, and after England. Indeed, the timing of the peak fits far better with the point where z ef f would be becoming significant than with anything related to the time at which social distancing was imposed. Assuming an if r or variation in susceptibility the same as England, the peak occurs roughly when z ef f = 0.15. A week earlier, when by comparison with Italy, Spain and England one might expect the peak to occur, z ef f = 0.08. During May there is a steady decline in the rate for Belgium, consistent with a current value of z ef f which would be z ef f \u2248 0.25. Additionally, the results in this article would suggest that in the Stockholm region of Sweden the rate of death may start noticeably slowing soon, despite the much less rigorous social distancing applied in Sweden. In general, the inferred if r and/or variation in susceptibility in this article suggests that the effective number of people infected is rather higher, by a factor of about 3, than estimates in e.g. [15] . Of, course, in all regions, the extractions of if r from indirect methods such as those in this article can only be confirmed or refuted by dedicated and reliable tests on fractions of the population with antibodies. However, relatively small, but well controlled sampling, representative of the total population, should give good indications, though of course, like fatality rates these will give an indication of the number of people who had become infected some time in the past, allowing for the average time it takes before an individual will have built up detectable antibodies. This is again perhaps of order 20 days, and hence results must be treated with care in how this uncertainty is ascertained when comparing to the total number of fatalities. As noted, the values of z and if r inferred here are indeed similar to a number of seroprevalence tests [4] [5] [6] [7] , which give values of if r = 0.001 \u2212 0.005, 4 and to the result from a study of excesses in influenza-related illnesses in the USA [13] , which show a strong correlation with high incidence of Covid-19. It is perhaps the case, though, that some later large scale tests, e.g. [14] suggest a value of if r near to the standard 0.01. However, if concrete and accurate evidence of if r being no lower than about 0.01 is found this still leaves open the possibility of variable susceptibility and the same practical effect of a larger effective infected proportion. Unless the most densely populated regions in some countries are somehow managing to achieve social distancing distinctly more successfully than other regions, the effective fraction infected must be larger than the values of 0.1 or so currently assumed for regions such as Lombardy, Madrid and London.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2109, "end": 2113, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2978, "end": 2981, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2982, "end": 2985, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2986, "end": 2989, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2990, "end": 2993, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3126, "end": 3130, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3270, "end": 3274, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "I conclude by noting that if the analysis in this article is correct, it does also rely on the fact that those people who have become infected are no longer susceptible to further infection, at the very least for some short period of time.
