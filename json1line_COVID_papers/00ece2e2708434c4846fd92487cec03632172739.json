Patient self-assessments can be important indicators of fall risk, as patients may better understand their capabilities/limitation than what the physical tests demonstrate. 8 The ability to walk, stand, climb stairs, and other mobility-related functional tasks, are critical components of achieving functional independence.

(which was not certified by peer review) putting both therapists and patients at risk for injury. Incorporating robotic technologies to neurological rehabilitation can play a critical role in delivering safe and effective gait and balance therapy. 9 The integration of body-weight support systems (BWSSs) following a stroke, spinal cord injury, or other neurological disorders has continued to expand over the last two decades, and the range of tools that therapists can use to treat these patients continues to grow. 10 Using BWSSs to unload paretic lower limbs, patients with gait impairments can practice a higher repetition of steps in a safe, controlled manner. As the patient performs gait training, these systems support the patient's body-weight, permitting patients with excessive weakness and poor coordination, to ambulate and perform more intensive therapy sessions sooner in their recovery, with minimal risk injurious fall. In addition to BWSSs, balance perturbation systems, which purposefully unbalance a patient so they can rehabilitate their postural control, have been used to improve gait and balance-control after stroke, or other age and disease related balance impairments. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a recently developed, not yet reported, balance perturbation module for the ZeroG BWSS. This new balance perturbation training module is directly integrated into the BWSS and allows therapists to induce safe lateral, anterior, or posterior perturbations via a Wi-Fi-enabled handheld device. During both stationary and ambulatory activities, this system was used unbalance participants in order to train their balance-control and balance-reactions. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine if this newly developed BWSS balance perturbation system more effectively rehabilitates patient gait and balance after stroke than the standard BWSS protocol without perturbations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 57, "end": 58, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 298, "end": 299, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 528, "end": 529, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 642, "end": 643, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 782, "end": 783, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 905, "end": 906, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1108, "end": 1109, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1263, "end": 1264, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1455, "end": 1456, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1755, "end": 1756, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2448, "end": 2449, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2718, "end": 2720, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 3397, "end": 3401, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3402, "end": 3406, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3407, "end": 3411, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3412, "end": 3416, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 3417, "end": 3421, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3422, "end": 3426, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": ".
