E6,E7 Furthermore, on the basis of a a priori hypothesis, we examined the heterogeneity of effect on the outcome according to the 4 asthma phenotypes, by repeating the analysis based on potential coexistence of allergic disease or of COPD. In the epidemiological analysis, we used the data of 65,677 participants with asthma, 31,442 allergic asthma, 34,235 nonallergic asthma, 7,836 asthma with COPD, and 57,841 asthma without COPD, in addition to 427,091 participants without asthma or COPD (the common reference group). E4 Genome-wide association study analysis. To compute a PRS for each of asthma (overall) and its phenotypes, we first performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis adjusting for age, sex, genotyping array, and 30 ancestry principal components. The UK Biobank has 2 types of genotyping array. First, 49,950 participants involved in the UK Biobank Lung Exome Variant Evaluation (UK BiLEVE) study were genotyped using the Applied Biosystems UK BiLEVE Axiom Array by Affymetrix (807,411 markers). Following this, 438,427 participants were genotyped using the closely related Applied Biosystems UK Biobank Axiom Array (825,927 markers).

We used the first set as the base data set to generate GWAS summary statistics, and used the remaining data as the target data set for computing the PRSs.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Statistical analysis"}, {"text": "PRS is a score that aggregates genetic variants aiming to predict disease risk. Before computing PRSs, we used the UK Biobank base data set (n 5 200,208) to generate GWAS summary statistics for each of the 5 asthma groups: asthma (overall), allergic asthma, nonallergic asthma, asthma with COPD, and asthma without COPD. Then, we used the LDpred method E10 to compute the PRS model coefficients based on approximately 660,000 SNPs, and applied the selected model to the independent target data set (n 5 201,261) from the UK Biobank to generate each PRS for participants in the target data set. In addition, we used another strategy to generate a PRS to predict the risk of overall asthma. In the second strategy, we retrieved the European fixed-effect model GWAS summary statistics from Trans-National Asthma Genetic Consortium (n 5 127,669) E11 as an independent base data set, applied the LDpred method to compute model coefficients using approximately 1,480,000 SNPs, and then computed the asthma (overall) PRS in an independent target data set (n 5 401,469) from UK Biobank. As opposed to removing SNPs with high-linkage disequilibrium (LD), LDpred is a Bayesian method that adjusts the effect sizes from the GWAS by using a prior and LD information from an external reference panel to estimate the LD structure among SNPs. LDpred consists of 3 steps. The first step is data synchronization. In this step, we used ''ldpred coord'' function to generate coordinated data that synchronize the genotypes and GWAS summary statistics. The second step is LDpred SNP weights generation. In this step, we used ''ldpred gibbs'' function to generate a reweighted effect estimate for each SNP. We computed the SNP weights on the basis of HRC SNPs. E9 The third step is individual PRS generation. We used ''ldpred score'' function to generate the individual's PRS in the target data set. For each of the asthma groups, we calculated 7 PRSs using models with different priors on the fraction of causal markers (ie, the fraction of markers with nonzero effects)-0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0. Among these 7 PRSs for each of asthma groups, we selected a PRS with the highest area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve that discriminates each group (Table E2) .
