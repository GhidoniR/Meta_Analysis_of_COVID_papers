One potential response to this problem is redeployment of non-critical care providers to increase the supply of available clinicians. To support efforts to increase capacity as part of surge preparation for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Seattle, Washington, the University of Washington School of Medicine's Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine created an online educational resource for nonintensivist providers to learn basic critical care content.

Many of the frameworks presented here assume availability of the technology and resources present in a modern ICU and rely heavily on the presence of a multidisciplinary team including a critical care nurse, respiratory therapist, and pharmacist. The guides also assume that a critical care \"consultant\" is available (in person or virtually) whenever care must deviate from the included schema or when the complexity of a problem is beyond the scope of these basic algorithms. Because many providers who may be called to help in the ICU will lack training in specific procedures, interpretation of hemodynamic data, or point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS), these aids intentionally deemphasize these skills. Despite these assumptions, these guides were drafted to be appropriately broad, such that a non-critical caretrained provider can perform core critical care tasks. This set of documents addresses the initial management of hypoxemia, spanning issues that arise both before and after intubation is required. We also focus on choosing initial ventilator settings for the newly intubated patient, blood gas analysis, and liberation from mechanical ventilation. Volume control ventilation is assumed in these guides as the primary mode due the fact that it is our local institutional practice. In addition, local sedation practices lean heavily toward a guideline-concordant analgesia-first regimen (3), with as-needed fentanyl and reserving propofol as the first-line agent when continuous sedative infusion is required.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The approaches in this section are meant to provide a general framework for the initial management of hypoxemic patients, including those on mechanical ventilation.

Each patient is unique, and more nuanced management may be necessary than can be provided in a one-page document. We designed the content to be simple, streamlined, and easy to use at the bedside by providers with varying levels of experience.
