Using synthetic SARS-COV-2 diagnostic RNA, the reduction in the N1 primer concentration from 1500 nM to 300 nM (five-fold or 500%) and the probe from 375 nM to 150 nM (2.5-fold or 250%) did not affect the PCR amplification efficiency of the assay, but a 3.2-fold decrease in LOD was observed (7.3 versus 23.7 copies/reaction). However, it is expected that the diagnostic capability of the clinical samples with viral loads higher than 23.7 copies/reaction is not affected, as observed in . We concluded that a decrease in the primer/probe concentration will not affect the vast majority of the diagnostics, only those with viral loads between 7.2 copies/reaction (~722 copies/mL of viral transport media) and 23.7 copies/reaction (~2370 copies/mL of viral transport media).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 108, "end": 111, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 544, "end": 548, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Reducing the thermocycling time is an alternative to increase the number of tests that could be performed per day, as the new thermocycler was under stock depletion from the manufactures.

Using synthetic SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic RNA, the reduction in the thermocycling time as described above did not affect the PCR amplification efficiency of the N1 assay, but did decrease the assay LOD to 44.2 copies/reaction (six-fold compared with the original LOD). The same deliberation used above for the primer concentration can be used here (median Cq values of 23.87 for [\u2212] versus 24.92 for [\u2212] fast). We concluded that reducing the thermocycling time will not affect the vast majority of diagnostics, only those with viral loads between 7.2 copies/reaction (~722 copies/mL viral transport media) and 44.2 copies/reaction (~4420 copies/mL of viral transport media).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "It is expected that limit of detection matters and low viral load infections will be missed [23] .

Using real clinical samples with Cq value ranging from~12.15 to~36.46, the results of the three tested conditions were almost identical. This observation corroborates the amplification efficiency experiment, where the assay presented a linear response similar to this range ( Figure 4a) . Indeed, some laboratories use a Cq cut-off value of 35-36 [24] , which means that reactions that returns Cq higher that these values are judge as negative or indeterminate results.
