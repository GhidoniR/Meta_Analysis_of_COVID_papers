The number of coronavirus cases are significantly positively associated with both volatility measures and we find that a one percent increase in cases is associated with about 0.09% increase in volatility measured via range volatility measure and about 0.21% increase in volatility measured via GARCH (1,1) measure. Similarly, a one percent increase in the number of deaths is associated with 0.083% increase in VOLT while about 0.22% increase in GVOLT suggesting that increases in both cases and deaths led to the instability of the markets. Moreover, an increase in the number of coronavirus cases by 10,000 is associated with about a 0.12% increase in market volatility when measured using the range volatility measure and an increase of about 0.29% using the GARCH (1,1) volatility measure. Similarly, an increase in the number of deaths by 1,000 is associated with a 0.22% increase in volatility using the range volatility measure while an increase of about 0.58% using the (1,1) measure. The mobility measure LNUSDWT is very strongly negatively associated with both volatility measures with coefficients ranging from -.071 in column [3] to -1.91 in column[9]. Similarly, both our (negative) sentiment indexes have a strong positive relationship with market volatility. In economic terms, a one percent increase in GSENT index (i.e. decrease in global sentiment) is associated with about 0.65% increase in VOLT and about 1.16% increase in GVOLT. Similarly, a one percent increase in GTREND index is associated with about 0.35% increase in VOLT and about 0.77% increase in GVOLT suggesting that growing panic and increasing negative sentiments contributed to stock market volatility. Finally, our LNSTRINGENCY variable is also significantly positively related to both market volatility measures. A one percent increase in stringency index is associated with about 0.25% increase in VOLT and about 0.60% increase in GVOLT suggesting that government regulatory responses such as mandatory lockdowns had a negative impact on market volatility.Overall, the results of our empirical tests support the notion that COVID-19 related human costs, panic, and subsequent regulatory responses had an adverse impact on the liquidity and volatility of US equity markets. Our results are generally inline with prior literature connecting pandemics and fear-inducing news with equity market dynamics(Mehra and Sah, 2002;Ichev and Marin\u010d, 2018;Donadelli et al., 2017;Haroon and Rizvi, 2020b).
