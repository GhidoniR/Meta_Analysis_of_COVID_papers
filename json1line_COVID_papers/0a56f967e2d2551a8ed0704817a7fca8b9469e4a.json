Some prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic antibodies have already 42 showed striking effectiveness against COVID-19. Nevertheless, concerns remain about antigenic 43 drift in SARS-CoV-2 as well as threats from other sarbecoviruses. Cross-neutralizing antibodies 44 to SARS-related viruses provide opportunities to address such concerns. Here, we report on 45 crystal structures of a cross-neutralizing antibody CV38-142 in complex with the receptor binding 46 domains from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Our structural findings provide mechanistic insights 47 into how this antibody can accommodate antigenic variation in these viruses. CV38-142 48 synergizes with other cross-neutralizing antibodies, in particular COVA1-16, to enhance 49 neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.

COVA1-16 binds to 171 a highly conserved epitope on RBD in the same approach angle as we reported before (Liu et al., 172 6 2020). However, CV38-142 binds to a less conserved surface with no overlap with the COVA1-16 173 epitope (Liu et al., 2020) and involves the N-glycosylation site at N343 on the RBD that is distal 174 to the RBS ( Figure 3A and Figure S2A ).

CV38-142 binds SARS-CoV RBD at the same site with an 218 identical approach angle, albeit interacting with some different residues in the RBD. Interaction 219 with the conserved N330 glycan ( Figure 3B and Figure S2D ), and the conserved N427 and N437 220 ( Figure 4C ) are the same as with SARS-CoV-2. Similar hydrophobic interactions are maintained 221 8 with I428 in SARS-CoV RBD and L441 in SARS-CoV-2 RBD ( Figure 4C ). However, interactions 222 with K444 are lost in CV38-142 binding to SARS-CoV RBD due a change to the corresponding 223 T431 in SARS-CoV RBD (Table S2) . A hydrophilic surface of CDRH3 of CV38-142 is now 224 juxtaposed to F360 of SARS-CoV RBD compared to S373 of SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The phenyl 225 moiety of F360 adopts heterogeneous conformations with diffuse electron density in the X-ray 226 structure ( Figure S4E ). Side chains of other epitope residues of SARS-CoV RBD that differ from 227 SARS-CoV-2 RBD are well adapted to the binding interface with no clashes or significant changes 228 in the CV38-142 structure. Thus, the overall binding of CV38-142 to SARS-CoV RBD is essentially 229 identical to SARS-CoV-2 ( Figures 1A and 3A ) despite a few differences in specific interactions 230 ( Figures 4A and 4C ). It would appear to be unusual that the binding between an antibody and 231 antigen would be retained at the same level with half of the polar interactions being depleted in 232 the interface of a cross-reacting protein (Table 2) . One explanation is the abundance of water 233 molecules mediating interaction between CV38-142 and both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBD. Figure S4D ). These water-mediated interactions are mostly conserved in the interaction with 246 9 CV38-142 with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBDs, with 15 that overlap and mediate interactions 247 with both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBD ( Figure 5 ). Considering the contribution from these 248 water molecules, the loss of some direct contacts between CV38-142 and SARS-CoV RBD may 249 be partially compensated by these abundant water-mediated interactions, suggesting a potential 250 mechanism whereby CV38-142 could resist antigenic drift.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 106, "end": 115, "text": "Figure 3A", "ref_id": "FIGREF63"}, {"start": 118, "end": 126, "text": "Table S1", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 322, "end": 331, "text": "Figure 3B", "ref_id": "FIGREF63"}, {"start": 336, "end": 346, "text": "Figure S2D", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 388, "end": 397, "text": "Figure 4C", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 542, "end": 551, "text": "Figure 4C", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 695, "end": 705, "text": "(Table S2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 957, "end": 967, "text": "Figure S4E", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1272, "end": 1289, "text": "Figures 1A and 3A", "ref_id": "FIGREF63"}, {"start": 1349, "end": 1366, "text": "Figures 4A and 4C", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1589, "end": 1598, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1734, "end": 1744, "text": "Figure S4D", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1967, "end": 1975, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "216"}, {"text": "CV38-142 accommodates rather than competes with ACE2 binding to the RBD 252 Structure superimposition of ACE2 bound to RBD reveals no clash between ACE2 and CV38-253 142.

There seems to be sufficient space for the remainder of the glycan 256 to be accommodated due to the large open void between CV38-142 and ACE2. In addition, we 257 observe some flexibility in this region (S60-H66) of CV38-142 that would allow even more room 6B), indicating that it is not possible for an CV38-142 IgG to bind two RBDs bivalently in either 295 two \"up\" or one \"up\", one \"down\" states within a spike trimer. For spike with RBDs in all \"down\" 296 state, we aligned the crystal structure of CV38-142 Fab to a cryoEM structure of dimeric spike 297 trimer (PDB: 7JJJ). The structural alignment reveals that the distance between any two C-termini 298 of CV38-142 Fab bound within a spike trimer is around 106 \u00c5, which also suggests that CV38-142 299 is unlikely to bind two RBDs in the \"down\" state within a spike trimer ( Figure 6D ). On the other 300 hand, CV38-142 Fabs can bind RBDs from two adjacent spikes in a dimer seen in Novavax 301 vaccine candidate NVAX-CoV2373 (Bangaru et al., 2020) with a distance of 26 \u00c5 between the 302 C-termini of the Fabs, suggesting that a CV38-142 IgG can bind a dimeric spike, or two spikes 303 that are close together, with its two Fabs bound to RBDs from neighboring spikes ( Figure 6D ).
