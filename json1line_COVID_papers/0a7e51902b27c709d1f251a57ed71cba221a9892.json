COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020) and has spread rapidly across the globe. The United States recently reached a grim milestone of 200,000 COVID-19-related deaths (CDC, 2020) . COVID-19 has had a severe impact on healthcare systems, economic activity, and has caused widespread social disruption. The effects of COVID-19 on mental health and emotional well-being are likely to be enormous as well. A recent survey by the U.S. Census Bureau found that one-third of Americans are showing signs of clinical anxiety or depression related to COVID-19 (National Center for Health Statistics, 2020) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 336, "end": 347, "text": "(CDC, 2020)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 710, "end": 764, "text": "COVID-19 (National Center for Health Statistics, 2020)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "It is critical to study the factors that relate to impaired mental health and emotional symptoms in response to COVID-19 to understand how the public responds to pandemic illness threats. Existing research has investigated factors related to mental health symptoms in response to illness threats such as the H1N1 \"Swine Flu\" influenza (Tausczik et al., 2012; Wheaton et al., 2012) , Zika virus (Blakey and Abramowitz, 2017) , SARS (Xie et al., 2011) , and Ebola (Blakey et al., 2015; Thompson et al., 2017) . This work has largely suggested that pandemic illness threats are associated with widespread anxiety and worry among the public. Importantly, anxiety about one's health can be helpful and adaptive in moderation, as it can focus attention and promote utilization of healthprotective behaviors (e.g., handwashing and maintaining social distance). However, for some individuals, anxiety in response to a pandemic threat can become excessive and maladaptive (Asmundson and Taylor, 2020) . Excessive anxiety can be debilitating and lead to severe impairment in functioning. In addition, some individuals may develop excessive behavioral responses to prevent infection. For example, past work (Brand et al., 2013) has linked anxiety about pandemic illnesses to extensive washing and cleaning compulsions, which are hallmark symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), a psychiatric disorder that can be disabling when severe (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 335, "end": 358, "text": "(Tausczik et al., 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 359, "end": 380, "text": "Wheaton et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 394, "end": 423, "text": "(Blakey and Abramowitz, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 431, "end": 449, "text": "(Xie et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 462, "end": 483, "text": "(Blakey et al., 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 484, "end": 506, "text": "Thompson et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 963, "end": 991, "text": "(Asmundson and Taylor, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1196, "end": 1216, "text": "(Brand et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1433, "end": 1473, "text": "(American Psychiatric Association, 2013)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Research suggests that fear about an illness and associated behavioral changes can also spread virally (Asmundson and Taylor, 2020) . For example, media reports about serious contagious illnesses can lead to threat-based reactions as has been shown historically, including in reports that link mass panic about the 1665 London plague to newspaper articles, prompting officials to shut down printing presses (Defoe, 2016) . Similarly, consumption of media reports about more recent pandemic illness outbreaks has also been associated with anxiety symptoms (Xie et al., 2011; Tausczik et al., 2012) . The mechanisms by which media reports lead to anxiety and other emotional reactions to a pandemic require further study. In particular, work is needed to determine which factors predispose certain individuals to experience these symptoms. One potential factor that has not received sufficient empirical attention is the construct of emotion contagion. Emotion contagion, a construct from the field of social psychology, refers to the well-established finding that the emotion and affective behavior experienced by one individual may be influenced by that of others through conscious or unconscious pathways (Hatfield et al., 1993) . For example, seeing other people cry at a funeral may provoke sadness and tearfulness in oneself. A large body of work in the field of social psychology supports the social transmission of emotion in laboratory experiments (Hatfield et al., 2014) . Recent experimental work also suggests that emotional states can be transferred to others via social media . Susceptibility to emotion contagion has been investigated as an individual difference variable, as some are more likely to take on social emotions than others. Evidence to support the notion that individuals differ in their tendency to be influenced by the emotions expressed by other people comes from data showing large individual differences in self-reported emotional contagion (Doherty, 1997; Sonnby-Borgstr\u00f6m, 2002) . In addition, self-reported susceptibility to emotion contagion has been linked to brain areas in the mirror neuron system for emotions (Lawrence et al., 2006; Pfeifer et al., 2007) as well as the ability to detect authentic facial emotions (Manera et al., 2013) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 103, "end": 131, "text": "(Asmundson and Taylor, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 407, "end": 420, "text": "(Defoe, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 555, "end": 573, "text": "(Xie et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 574, "end": 596, "text": "Tausczik et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1206, "end": 1229, "text": "(Hatfield et al., 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1455, "end": 1478, "text": "(Hatfield et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1972, "end": 1987, "text": "(Doherty, 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1988, "end": 2011, "text": "Sonnby-Borgstr\u00f6m, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2149, "end": 2172, "text": "(Lawrence et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2173, "end": 2194, "text": "Pfeifer et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2254, "end": 2275, "text": "(Manera et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Several forms of emotions appear to be socially contagious, including happiness, anger, and anxiety (Behnke et al., 1994) .

In addition, our sample was non-clinical, and therefore, future research is needed in clinical populations.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Hours per day of social media use weakly yet significantly related to concern about COVID-19, but this relationship did not reach significance in our regression model controlling for gender and consumption of COVID-19 related media. Among the secondary outcomes, time interacting with social media did predict symptoms of depression and stress, but not anxiety or OCD symptoms. Emotion contagion did not moderate the link between social media use and the mental health outcome variables. This result suggests that simply using social media may not robustly be linked with all mental health outcomes during a pandemic threat. Rather it may be important to consider the content of social media with which one interacts. Emerging work has suggested that the mental health effects of social media use may be highly variable, with some forms of social media use linked to deleterious mental health outcomes, while other social media use (e.g., that which encourages belongingness and social connection) may improve mental health outcomes (Clark et al., 2018) . Thus, future research with more fine-grained analysis of social media utilization is needed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1033, "end": 1053, "text": "(Clark et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Present results should be interpreted in light of several important study limitations. First, all data were collected online utilizing a cross-sectional design in which participants completed measures at a single time point. Thus, our results are not able to firmly establish cause and effect relationships. For example, we cannot determine whether media exposure increased anxiety or whether individuals with heightened anxiety were more likely to seek information and therefore spent more time engaging with media. A more powerful design would be a longitudinal study to follow individuals low and high in emotion contagion to compare their utilization of social media and trajectories for anxiety and stress in response to a pandemic threat. Similarly, other variables (such as neuroticism) should be considered as potential third variables explaining the associations between observed relationships. Unfortunately, neuroticism was not assessed in our survey, representing an important future direction for research. In addition, all data were collected via selfreport surveys, and reliance on self-report questionnaires may have inflated the relationship between variables due to shared methods variance. Future study using mixed methods approaches including interviews would add methodological diversity to measurement. Finally, the data were limited to a student sample (that was mostly female). Therefore, future research is needed to replicate these findings in other samples, including among clinical samples of individuals experiencing anxiety disorders who may be particularly affected by fears of pandemic illness threats (Dennis et al., 2020) , as well as samples with greater numbers of male participants. Given that the results of some of the present analyses were statistically significant but of small magnitude, their clinical significance requires further study.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1634, "end": 1655, "text": "(Dennis et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "LIMITATIONS"}, {"text": "Notwithstanding these limitations, the present report highlights the possibility that emotion contagion effects may contribute to emotional reactions during a pandemic illness outbreak, such as COVID-19.
