In contrast to this, O 3 concentrations were generally 411 higher than normal, which can be attributed to lower than normal emissions of NO due to 412 restrictions placed on industrial activities and travel.

In fact, N O emissions comprise the bulk, 90-95% , 274 of N O X emissions (E PA inventory documentation). In the short term, N O can destroy ozone, 275 while in the longer term, N O is converted to N O 2 and catalyzes O 3 production. T his rate of 276 production of O 3 process is dependent on the magnitudes of N O and N O 2 in comparison with 277 V O C s and other O 3 precursors. T herefore, this increase in O 3 concentrations is mainly ex plained 278 by an unprecedented reduction in N O x emissions leading to a lower O 3 titration by N O . O zone 279 concentration is also strongly dependent on meteorological conditions, with O 3 formation 280 enhanced by higher temperatures. T hus, O 3 concentrations are generally higher in summer than 281 in spring. It is not known whether N O X emission reductions would have increased O 3 282concentrations in E urope if these reductions had occurred in summer rather than in S pring 283 in 2020(Goldberg et al., 2020). Similarly, concentrations of SO 2 and PM 2.5 were 287 35% and 6% lower, respectively, when compared against previous years. In contrast to this, 288 concentrations of CO and O 3 were, on average, 7% and 11% higher than the average 289 concentrations from 2015-2019(Figure 4). By April 2020, satellite observations of NO 2 were 290 19% lower than average while concentrations of PM 2.5 and O 3 were 3% and 15% above average.291Like Europe, these changes in ambient concentrations are likely due to lockdown measures taken 292 during mid-March across the US. The observed increase in ozone, shown inFigure 4, is slightly 293 more prominent in the US than in Europe due to the southern areas of the US observing much 294 warmer temperatures in March and April, which is favorable for ozone formation.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "Satellite observations of NO 2 were also observed at a continental scale. Europe saw the largest296 reduction in NO 2 column loading in April (18%) when compared against the base years, while 297 South America saw the smallest reduction (-0.79%) in March. The average reduction of NO 2 298 over all continents except Antarctica was about 14-15% in March and April. This is consistent 299 with the reduction in CO 2 emissions from combustion estimated by Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al (2020) during 300 this period. While there was an overall global reduction, the magnitude of the reductions can 301 likely be attributed to restrictions placed upon each country during this period. Because COVID-302 19 did not reach South America until late February (compared with December 2019 in the US 303 and January 2020 in Europe), restrictions were not as strict during this study period when 304 compared against other continents and countries. For example, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, is the largest 305 city in Latin America, with a population of 12,252,023 people. Nakada and Urban (2020) study 306 during similar time period, indicated the pollution of the megacity Sao Paula observed averaged 307 concentrations of PM10 increased and PM2.5 decreased by about 9% and \u22120.3% respectively; 308 while gaseous pollutants between pre and during lockdown reduced by about NO2 (\u221222%), CO 309 (\u221230%). The maximum concentration of O3 increased about (+11% overall variation). 310 A study by Shi and Brasseur (2020) using data collected from ground-based monitoring stations 311 during lockdowns in China found that PM 2.5 and NO 2 concentrations have decreased by about 312 35% and 60%, respectively. Similarly, a study by Venter et al., (2020) using a network of 313 >10,000 air quality stations in 34 countries found that PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations decreased 314 by about 31% and 60%, respectively. These reductions were attributed to the reduced economic 315 and transport activities in major cities. Like the US and Europe, their study also observed an 316 increase by a factor 1.5-2 in O 3 concentrations during the same period.317 In India, Sharma et al. (2020) investigated the changes in air pollutant concentrations in 22 cities 318 during the period March 16 to April 14, 2020. Their finding indicated reductions in PM 2.5 , PM 10 , 319 CO, and NO 2 by 43%, 31%, 10%, and 18%, respectively. An increase in O 3 by 17% was 320 observed in their analysis, suggesting these cities underwent the same pathway of O 3 production 321 and its precursors (explained earlier). Moreover, Mohato et al. (2020) study during similar time 322 period, indicated the pollution of the megacity Delhi observed substantial reduction of the 323 particulate matter pollutants averaged concentrations for PM10 and PM2.5 by about \u221252% and studies on changes of pollutant concentrations at city level 328 The change in pollutants, both satellite measurements of NO 2 and ground measurements of 329 PM 2.5 , PM 10 , CO, NO 2 , SO 2 and O 3 , at the city level were also examined. Four major cities were 330 chosen in this analysis: New York City (USA), Milan (Italy), Wuhan (China), and New Delhi 331 (India). Figure 5A shows the concentrations of pollutants in New York as a fraction of the 332 average concentration of the base period (2015-2019) on a monthly temporal scale. The monthly 333 analysis shows concentrations of PM 2.5 , NO 2 , SO 2 and CO declining (90\u00b15%, 36\u00b18%, 40\u00b135%, 334 and 10\u00b13%, respectively) in the study period. In New York, NO 2 satellite observations were 51% 335 and 28% lower, on average, in March and April 2020, respectively, when compared with the 336 baseline average column loadings for the given month from 2015-2020. In contrast, ambient 337 measurements of SO 2 show concentrations increasing by 10\u00b110% during the period. In Milan, 338 concentrations of PM, NO 2 , CO and SO 2 all drastically declined (22\u00b119%, 40\u00b110%, 30\u00b130%, 339 and 30\u00b130%, respectively) between January and February before increasing through the end of 340 the study period (Figure 5B). In contrast, O 3 concentrations were above average (18\u00b18%) 341 compared with previous years. In Milan, NO 2 satellite observations were 55% and 49% lower, 342 on average, in March and April 2020, respectively, when compared with the baseline average 343 column loadings for the given month from 2015-2020. The concentrations of pollutants from 344 January to April of 2020 as a fraction of the average concentration in the base period for Wuhan, 345 China, were also observed on a monthly scale (Figure 5C). On a monthly scale, the 346 concentrations of CO declined through the period, while concentrations of SO 2 and O 3 steadily 347 increased. In contrast to this, PM and NO 2 concentrations initially decreased before starting to 348 increase in March/April. In Wuhan, NO 2 satellite observations were 62%, 50% and 18% lower, 349 on average, in February, March and April 2020, respectively, when compared with the baseline 350 average column loadings for the given month from 2015-2020. The concentrations of pollutants 351 from January to April of 2020 as a fraction of the average concentration in the base period for 352 New Delhi, India, were also observed on a monthly scale (Figure 5D). The average monthly 353 concentrations of CO increased through March before dropping in April, while concentrations of 354 NO 2 , PM and O 3 all peaked in February before declining, with all pollutants, except SO 2 , at a 355 minimum in April. In New Delhi, India, NO 2 satellite observations were 24% and 54% lower, on 356 average, in March and April 2020, respectively, when compared with the baseline average 357 column loadings for the given month from 2015-2020. The reduction in CO, PM and NO 2 358 concentrations can likely be primarily attributed to the mandatory shut down of non-essential 359 personnel. Because the timings of the mandatory quarantine periods varied city to city, the 360 timelines for changes in the concentrations also vary. The increase in O 3 can be attributed to the 361 reduction of NO emissions from automobiles and industrial activities. Similarly, the increase in 362 NO 2 and decrease in O 3 concentrations toward the end of the study period can be attributed to a 363 likely increase in NO emissions which then react with the O 3 to create NO 2 . SO 2 concentrations 364 sharply increase through the period toward the end of the study period. A potential cause for this 365 sharp increase in emissions could potentially be from an increase in truck and air traffic the relationship for N ew D elhi, India, and M ilan, Italy, between the N O 2 ob-369 servations during max imum photochemical activity (11.00 A M to 6.00 PM ) versus max imum 8 370 hour O 3 concentrations during the same time window (also reflecting max imum photochemical 371 activity) for March and A pril for 2015 to 2019 (before lockdown i.e. F igure 6 A and C ), and 372 2020 (during and after lockdown i.e. F igure 6 B and D ). B efore the lockdown 2015 to 2019 case 373 in N ew D elhi (F igure 6 A ) the ozone concentration increases with increasing N O 2 (the infor-374 mation on the emissions of V O C s is not available) (N R C 1991). H owever, in M ilan (F igure 6 C ) 375 the concentration of surface ozone decreases with increased concentration of N O 2 . W hen the ni-376 tric ox ide (N O ) concentrations are large, N O released in the atmosphere from fossil fuel combus-377 tion reacts with ozone to form N O 2 . A fter lockdown, F igure 6 B and D we observe a reduction in 378 N O 2 leads to an increase of the ozone concentration. W hen the lockdown kicked in in N ew D elhi 379 and Milan, nitrogen diox ide levels plummeted as the automotive traffic reduced, but ozone levels 380 rose. N itric ox ide, which is also in traffic ex haust reacts with ozone to produce N O 2 (N O + O 3 \u2192 381 N O 2 + O 2 ). T his happens almost instantaneousl y. I n effect ozone is being \"converted\" into nitro-382 gen diox ide in equal measure, so that the total of both gases (\"O x \") remains about the same 383 (S illman et al., 1990; M onks et al., 2015; S hi and B rasseur, 2020). H owever, it is important to 384 note that there is a lot of variability and uncertainty in the data because of the influence of other 385 variables (e.g. measurement uncertainty, meteorology, transport of background ozone and its 386 precursors, etc.5-years of data into our calculation of the baseline prior to the C O V ID 390 lockdowns. T he compared five-year period was used as the baseline for air quality not influenced 391 by the lockdowns provides a more robust analysis. T he purpose of the inclusion of this period is 392 two-fold: (1) to normalize the impacts of meteorological factors to the atmospheric 393 concentrations of air pollutants;(2) to narrow down the case studies to locations that have long-394 term measurements and data-series. B y means of normalizing the meteorological influences and 395narrowing down the case studies, this study attempts to corroborate a closer ex amination on the 396 lockdown effect rather than to generalize the findings by incorporating more locations with a 397shorter data coverage. M oreover, incorporating a short baseline period may result in a bias 398 inherited from prevalent meteorological conditions during that period. B y introducing a longer 399 baseline period, this bias may be minimized. T his is evident from the suggested ex amination of 400 meteorological effects on air pollutant concentrations that indicates meteorology has a small 401 influence on the changes of air quality during the lockdowns (-1% to 3% across all species). 402 G round based measurements of S O 2 , C O , PM 2.5 , PM 10 , O 3 and N O 2 were ex amined across 403 E urope and for four major cities: M ilan (I taly), W uhan (C hina), N ew Y ork C ity (U S A ) and N ew 404 D elhi (India).

These changes in the 422 concentrations of these pollutants can likely be, in part, attributed to the reductions in traffic and 423 industrial activity associated with lockdown measures taken to contain COVID-19. The increase 424 in O 3 concentrations can likely be attributed to a reduction in NO emissions, which thus reduces 425 the reaction of NO with O 3 to form NO 2 .

With the reduction in industrial 431 activities and residential automobile activity, the ambient concentrations of PM, CO, NO 2 and, in 432 some cases, SO 2 were much lower than they normally are likely due to a combination of lower 433 emissions and meteorological conditions. In contrast to this, O 3 concentrations were higher than 434 normal due to the reduction in emissions from traffic. It is important to note that these changes in 435 ambient concentrations are not permanent and it is not possible at this time to determine any 436 long-term impacts of this reduction in emissions on air quality at a global, regional and urban 437 scales.
