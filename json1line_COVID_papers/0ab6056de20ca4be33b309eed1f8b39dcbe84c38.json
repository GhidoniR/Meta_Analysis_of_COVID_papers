There is scarce information about the performance of those visits. Aim: To compare telephone visits during the COVID-19 lockdown period with previous in-person visits. Design: Retrospective descriptive study. Methods: Telephone visits from 15 March to 31 May 2020 were compared with in-person visits during the same period in 2019. Main measures: The proportions of both groups were compared in term of failure to contact patient, requested diagnostic tests/referrals, discharges, admissions and emergency visits within 30-60 days. A sample of patients, and all participating physicians completed surveys. Z-score test was used (statistical significance P<0.05). Results: A total of 5602 telephone visits were conducted. In comparison to in-person visits, telephone visits showed higher rates of visit compliance (95.9% vs. 85.2%, P<0.001) and discharges (22.12% vs. 11.82%; P<0.001), and lower number of ancillary tests and referrals. During the 30-and 60-day periods following the telephone visit, a reduction of 52% and 47% in the combined number of emergency department visits and hospital admissions was observed compared to in-person visits (P<0.01). Of the 120 patients surveyed, 95% were satisfied/very satisfied with the telephone visits. Of the 26 physicians, 84.6% considered telephone visits were useful to prioritize patients.

It is likely that patients were less demanding during telephone visits, therefore making the medical act easier and minimizing the problems presented in them 23 or the discussion of medical decisions. The doubling in the rate of discharges in telephone visits is difficult to explain and has probably multiple causes. Patients' predisposition not to discuss discharges, the perception by physicians of having to relieve the healthcare system of non-serious diseases or diseases that could wait further evaluation and the fact that televisits had a legal coverage since the beginning of the confinement 24 may have contributed to increase physicians' confidence in making decisions.
