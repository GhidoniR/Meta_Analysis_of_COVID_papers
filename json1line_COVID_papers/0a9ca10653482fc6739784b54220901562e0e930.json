Earlier studies have examined various factors that may contribute to the contagion rate of COVID-19, such as air pollution, smoking, humidity, and temperature. As there is a lack of studies at the neighborhood-level detailing the spatial settings of built environment attributes, this study explored the variations in the size of the COVID-19 confirmed case clusters across the urban district Huangzhou in the city of Huanggang. Clusters of infectious cases in the initial outbreak of COVID-19 were identified geographically through GIS methods. The hypothetic relationships between built environment attributes and clusters of COVID-19 cases have been investigated with the structural equation model. The results show the statistically significant direct and indirect influences of commercial vitality and transportation infrastructure on the number of confirmed cases in an infectious cluster.

The sequent presence of human-to-human transmission has been confirmed based on the reports of an infected cluster of family members and healthcare works in different geographical regions (Jasper Fuk Woo Chan et al., 2020) . Nevertheless, genomic evidence has been provided that the virus was induced from another unknown location, and the human-to-human transmission may have occurred earlier (Shereen, Khan, Kazmi, Bashir, & Siddique, 2020; Yu, Bin, Da, Zhang, & Corlett, 2020) . Further investigation revealed that more than 70 % of the patients at the beginning of the outbreak had no exposure to the market (Li, Guan et al., 2020) . For sure, the COVID-19 has tremendous transmissibility . So far, its reproductive number of COVID-19 has been much higher than SARS, so does the number of people infected or died (Liu, Gayle, Wilder-Smith, & Rockl\u00f6v, 2020; Mahase, 2020) . As the viral transmission was tending more and more intensively, Wuhan's area was quarantined on 23 January 2020. Subsequent viral spread led to movement across Hubei province in 16 cities, affecting 50 million people (Sohrabi et al., 2020) .

Based on the idea that a cluster in data space is a contiguous region of high point density, separated from other such clusters by contiguous regions of low point density, the density-based clustering algorithms are efficient to deal with the arbitrary shaped clusters and finding the high-density and outliers (Dane, Borgers, & Feng, 2019; Daszykowski & Walczak, 2009 ). DBSCAN algorithm is a well-known data clustering algorithm, which stands for Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise. The key idea is that for each point of a cluster, the neighborhood of a given radius must contain at least a minimum number of points. Unlike k -means, DBSCAN is a non-parametric approach that does not require the number of clusters as an input parameter. Instead, it infers the number of clusters based on the data, and it can discover clusters of arbitrary shape comparing the spherical clusters in k -means. Based on DBSCAN, a point belongs to a cluster if close to many points from that cluster (see Fig. 3 ). Noise is defined relative to a given set of clusters, which is simply the set of points in data space not belonging to any clusters. The cutoff distance of the neighborhood is fundamental to DBSCAN to approximate local density. Therefore, the algorithm has two parameters determining the clustering outcome: (i) Eps (\u03b5): The cutoff distance specifies the neighborhoods. Two points are considered to be neighbors if the distance between two points is not more than \u03b5, and (ii) MinPts: Minimal number of data points for defining a cluster.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 488, "end": 517, "text": "(Dane, Borgers, & Feng, 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 518, "end": 545, "text": "Daszykowski & Walczak, 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1191, "end": 1197, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Density-based clustering algorithm"}, {"text": "DBSCAN stands out as a suitable algorithm for clustering the data of COVID-19 confirmed cases due to its ability to discover clusters of arbitrary shape without the prior knowledge of the existing number of clusters.
