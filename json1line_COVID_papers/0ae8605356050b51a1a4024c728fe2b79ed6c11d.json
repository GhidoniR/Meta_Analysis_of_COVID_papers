Cloud computing plays a significant role in this change by providing easy access to patients' medical records to all stakeholders, such as doctors, nurses, patients, life insurance agents, etc. Cloud services are scalable, cost-effective, and offer a broad range of mobile access to patients' electronic health record (EHR). Despite the cloud's enormous benefits like real-time data access, patients' EHR security and privacy are major concerns. Since the information about patients' health is highly sensitive and crucial, sharing it over the unsecured wireless medium brings many security challenges such as eavesdropping, modifications, etc. Considering the security needs of remote healthcare, this paper proposes a robust and lightweight, secure access scheme for cloud-based E-healthcare services. The proposed scheme addresses the potential threats to E-healthcare by providing a secure interface to stakeholders and prohibiting unauthorized users from accessing information stored in the cloud. The scheme makes use of multiple keys formed through the key derivation function (KDF) to ensure end-to-end ciphering of information for preventing misuse. The rights to access the cloud services are provided based on the identity and the association between stakeholders, thus ensuring privacy. Due to its simplicity and robustness, the proposed scheme is the best fit for protecting data security and privacy in cloud-based E-healthcare services.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Storing the health records manually and retaining them for future references becomes challenging to manage with large data volumes.

Gateway generates the nonce N 2 and concatenates it with all other values H I D || D I D || P I D || N 2 and form \u03bc. Then \u03bc is encrypted with M K to form \u03bb. Now gateway sends message S 2 to cloud. After receiving the message cloud decrypts \u03bb using M K to give \u03ba. If N 2 is fresh, then the operation is continued else aborted. The values H I D , P I D , D I D are verified, if found not true then process is aborted. It is verified if P I D belongs to D I D or not, if it does then the operation is proceeded with further.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF4": {"text": "Computational cost of proposed protocol", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF5": {"text": "Since it contains the old nonce (N 2 ), the cloud discards the request and terminate the session. Furthermore, adversary cannot read and alter the nonce's (N 1 , N 2 , N 3 , N 4 ) as messages M 1 and M 2 are ciphered with the public key of cloud whereas M 3 is encrypted with temporary key of gateway K T G . Hence any alteration requires either the private key of the cloud or the secret temporary key of gateway unknown to the attacker. Similarly, other messages are protected. Thus, the proposed scheme is secured against replay attacks.Theorem 2 Resistant to man in the middle (MITM) attack.Proof of Theorem 2 In a MITM attack, the adversary modifies the captured messages in such a way that the destination cannot differentiate the modified message from the original message. Assume an attacker performs MITM between the gateway and the cloud by capturing and modifying the message \u03b4 = E(\u03b2 || \u03b3 ). These computations are hard for the attacker due to the non-availability of the master key (M K ) required for deciphering the captured message. Therefore, the attacker fails to attempt a MITM attack between the gateway and the cloud. Similarly, other messages M N , K N , S N , are also encrypted and hence cannot be modified. Therefore, the proposed scheme is protected from MITM attacks.Theorem 3 Secure against modification attack.Proof of Theorem 3 Integrity is preserved due to the use of one way hash function (i.e., SHA). For example, the element O = hash (D I D ) guarantees prevention against modification attacks. Any form of alterations in O can be easily identified during reconstruction and hash comparison at other entities.
