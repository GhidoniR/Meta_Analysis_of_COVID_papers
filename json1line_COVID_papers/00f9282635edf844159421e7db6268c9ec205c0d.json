Previously, we have shown that N-glycosylation of recombinantly expressed receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike of IBV-M41 is of critical importance for binding to chicken trachea tissue. Here we investigated the role of N-glycosylation of the RBD on receptor specificity and virus replication in the context of the virus particle. Using our reverse genetics system we were able to generate recombinant IBVs for nine-out-often individual N-glycosylation mutants. In vitro growth kinetics of these viruses were comparable to the virus containing the wild-type M41-S1. Furthermore, Neu5Ac binding by the recombinant viruses containing single N-glycosylation site knock-out mutations matched the Neu5Ac binding observed with the recombinant RBDs. Five N-glycosylation mutants lost the ability to bind Neu5Ac and gained binding to a different, yet unknown, sialylated glycan receptor on host cells.

Previously, we observed that recombinantly expressed RBD-N126A lost its binding to chicken trachea tissue; however, this cannot be the sole explanation, as the same was observed for five other mutants (N33A, N59A, N85A, N160A and N194A) [15] , which apparently are able to bind a different sialic acid receptor now that they are introduced into the virion.

In our study using recombinant M41-RBD, we did not detect N-glycans on position N219, potentially due to inadequate amount of input material.

For other coronaviruses including Bovine CoV (BCoV) and Human CoV-OC43 (HCoV-OC43), both dependent on host glycan receptors containing terminal 9-O-acteylated sialic acids, the ligand binding sites are resolved and for both charged amino acids (BCoV: E182 and H185, HCoV-OC43: K81) and amino acids containing a ring structure (BCoV: Y162 and W184, HCoV-OC43: W90) are directly involved in ligand binding [21, 22] .

These amino acids are neither charged or contain a ring structure. However in the cryo-EM structure of IBV-M41, charged amino acids (D88, E161 and D164), and F86 containing a ring structure, are found near the predicted ligand binding site. Importantly, the predicted ligand binding site of IBV-M41 is surrounded by N-glycosylation sites N59, N85 and N160, which are all critical for Neu5Ac binding in our present study.

These results may be explained by the expression of different glycans on the cells used in this study, as we propose that at least two glycan receptors (Neu5Ac and an unknown receptor) are involved in binding of the r-M41 viruses to host cells. Since we were able to rescue the r-M41 viruses, analyse the growth kinetics and perform haemagglutination assays, we propose that both receptors are expressed on CAM tissue, CEK cells and chRBC.

Consequently, these N-glycans on the viral surface can mimic selfantigens [24] or mask neutralizing epitopes present on the virus attachment proteins, potentially leading to evasion from the host immune response [24] . For HIV, broadly neutralizing antibodies have been found in infected patients that target epitopes created by glycans present on the attachment protein, strongly suggesting that the viral 'glycan shield' can be important for vaccine development [25] .
