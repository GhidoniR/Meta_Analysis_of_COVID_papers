The mean knowledge score for our cohort was 7.67 (1.5). A total of 95% of women demonstrated adequate knowledge on COVID-19, with over four-fifths of our respondents answered all questions correctly. We found that tertiary education, employment status, household income (>RM 5000), and the higher number of information sources were significantly associated with adequate maternal knowledge on COVID-19. These factors remained significant following adjustment for age, ethnicity, and parity in the multivariable logistic regression analyses (Table 1) . Table 3 demonstrates the participants' perception towards the Movement Control Order and antenatal care during the COVID-19 pandemic. More than four-fifths of the participants believed that the Movement Control Order (MCO) is necessary (81.7%) and are willing to prolong it if necessary (85.0%). Three hundred and fifty-four participants (85.3%) agree that information from authority is accurate and transparent. Only less than one-fifth of the participants felt that they did not receive enough support during the MCO. Table 4 shows the maternal experience during the pandemic. Positive perception towards antenatal care was high among our cohort study, with almost 90% of them feeling that primary and tertiary centers were supportive and helpful during the pandemic.

Exploratory factor analysis on the four items of MCO perception confirmed single factor loading. The maternal experience questionnaire demonstrated two-factor loading.

Our urban cohort was more likely to have unlimited access to the internet and various online information resources, in comparison to rural, less-educated women with lower household income. Multiple sources of information also contributed to greater knowledge among our women. The use of the internet had exponentially increased with the onset of COVID-19. The MCO restriction to various daily activities resulted in increased demand for home-based entertainment, video conference, and online communication [25] . More people began to share and express their thoughts, emotions, and ideas online due to decreased options of more personal face-to-face interaction. This ultimately led to the growing number of social networking service users, with an estimated 26.1 million Malaysian users by 2023 [25] . As of January 2021, about 86 percent of the Malaysian population were active social media users, with Facebook being the most widely used platform [26] . Unsurprisingly, almost three-quarters of our respondents were Facebook users.
