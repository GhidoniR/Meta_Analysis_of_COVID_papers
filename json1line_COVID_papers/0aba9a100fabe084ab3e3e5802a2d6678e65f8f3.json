While the development of a vaccine requires a lot of time, a fast countermeasure could be the use of defective interfering particles (DIPs) for antiviral therapy. IAV DIPs are usually characterized by a large internal deletion in one viral RNA segment. Consequentially, DIPs can only propagate in presence of infectious standard viruses (STVs), compensating the missing gene function. Here, they interfere with and suppress the STV replication and might act \"universally\" against many IAV subtypes. We recently reported a production system for purely clonal DIPs utilizing genetically modified cells. In the present study, we established an automated perfusion process for production of a DIP, called DI244, using an alternating tangential flow filtration (ATF) system for cell retention. Viable cell concentrations and DIP titers more than 10-times higher than for a previously reported batch cultivation were observed. Further, we investigated a novel tubular cell retention device for its potential for continuous virus harvesting into the permeate. Very comparable performances to typically used hollow fiber membranes were found during the cell growth phase. During the virus replication phase the tubular membrane, in contrast to the hollow fiber membrane, allowed 100% of the produced virus particles to pass through. To our knowledge, this is the first time a continuous virus harvest was shown for a membrane-based perfusion process. Overall, the process established offers interesting possibilities for advanced process integration strategies for next-generation virus particle and virus vector manufacturing.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "2 Key points \uf0b7 An automated perfusion process for production of IAV DIPs was established \uf0b7 DIP titers of 7.40E+9 plaque forming units per mL were reached \uf0b7 A novel tubular cell retention device enabled continuous virus harvesting", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Infections with influenza A virus (IAV; list of abbreviations, Tab. 1) result worldwide in up to 650,000 deaths annually (Iuliano et al. 2018) . The potential of a pandemic is a constant threat, as IAV pandemics have led to millions of deaths in the past and highly infectious variants of this RNA virus can emerge at any time (Johnson and Mueller 2002; Taubenberger et al. 2000) . In case of such a pandemic situation, the use of antivirals could be crucial as a first line of defense to avoid a high number of deaths until a vaccine is available. Additionally, antivirals could be used to supplement vaccination during annual epidemics. Currently used antivirals against IAV include oseltamivir and zanamivir (Colman 2009; Oxford 2007; Smith et al. 2006) .

DIPs are virus mutants occurring naturally during the error-prone replication of the viral genome (Lazzarini et al. 1981; Perrault 1981) . The majority of IAV DIPs is characterized by a large deletion in the open reading frame of one of their eight viral RNA (vRNA) segments (Nayak et al. 1985) . Thus, DIPs lack the genetic information necessary for the synthesis of the corresponding full-length protein (Huang and Baltimore 1970) . Consequentially, DIPs are unable to replicate, unless the missing protein is provided, for example by a co-infection with the standard virus (STV). In such a co-infection, DI vRNAs seem to replicate faster than the full-length equivalent and therefore outcompete the STV vRNA for limited cellular resources (Dimmock and Easton 2014; Laske et al. 2016; Nayak et al. 1985) . In addition, other mechanisms might also play a role in suppressing STV replication and spreading Scott et al. 2011) . Overall, this results in a drastic decrease in released infectious virus particles, as mainly non-infectious DIPs are produced (Frensing 2015; Tapia et al. 2019; Von Magnus 1951) . The DIP-induced inhibition of STV replication is causative for their antiviral potential, previously demonstrated in mice (Dimmock et al. 2008) .

Unfortunately, this resulted in a relatively high variability of the produced material (contamination with multiple other DIPs). Furthermore, it required the inactivation of the infectious STV after harvesting, for example by UV irradiation. This UV irradiation also inactivated parts of the produced DIPs and therefore decreased the antiviral potency of final preparations used in animal trials (Hein et al. 2021b ). To overcome this limitation, a method for production of purely clonal DIP populations, devoid of STV and other DIPs, was developed (Bdeir et al. 2019) . Here, adherent Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were genetically modified to express the polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) encoded by IAV segment 1 (Seg1) vRNA. This allowed propagation of IAV DIPs with a deletion in Seg1. We recently reported the production of a prototypic Seg1 DIP, called DI244, utilizing a suspension MDCK cell line expressing PB2 (MDCK-PB2(sus)) and the evaluation of the produced DI244 in animal experiments (Hein et al. 2021a) . Here, all mice infected with an otherwise lethal dose of IAV survived the infection when treated with DI244. These experiments already clearly demonstrated the antiviral potential of these purely clonal DIPs.

For the manually adjusted perfusion rate, a perfusion profile was calculated based on the growth rate and metabolite consumption rates determined during the exponential phase of a previous batch cultivation (Hein et al. 2021a ). Here, the perfusion rate was increased stepwise every 12 hours. For the automated perfusion, a previously reported approach was used (Nikolay et al. 2018 ). Here, a multi-frequency capacitance probe connected to a controller (ArcView Controller 265, Hamilton) was utilized. The controller converted the measured capacity to a permittivity signal, which was correlated to the VCC in the STR (in the present study the permittivity signal was correlated to the viable cell volume (VCV) instead). The permittivity signal was forwarded to an analog 4 -20 mA output box (Hamilton), which then again was connected to the peristaltic pump (120 U, Watson-Marlow). The desired cell volume specific perfusion rate (CVSPR) was realized by adjusting the specific cell factor stored in the ArcView controller. In this study, a cell factor of 1.18 was used to achieve a CVSPR of 0.12 pL/\u00b5m 3 /d.
