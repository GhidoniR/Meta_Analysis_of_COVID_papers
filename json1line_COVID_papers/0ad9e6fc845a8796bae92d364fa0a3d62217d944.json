Moreover agreeableness and conscientious had an indirect effect on course achievement while none of the five-factor model personality traits had an influence on actual Moodle use. An improved respecified model further affirmed the importance of agreeableness and conscientious and their role in online academic selfefficacy, the acceptance and actual use of Moodle and course achievement outcomes.

Theoretical support can be drawn from the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) (Ajzen and Fishbein 1980; Fishbein and Ajzen 1975) which incorporates personality traits (extraversion and neuroticism) as external variables effecting beliefs which underpin action (Agarwal and Prasad 1999) . Informed by the TRA, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis 1989) provides an information-systems approach to assessing the adoption and acceptance of technology. The model is conceptualized on the premise that the perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and attitude toward technology informs the continuance intention of the user. While the TAM has been validated across several studies (for meta-analyses see King and He 2006; Mortenson and Vidgen 2016; Schepers and Wetzels 2007; Scherer et al. 2019; Weerasinghe and Hindagolla 2018) , only a small number of studies have examined the relationship between personality traits and technology acceptance. A limitation of the TAM is that both the continuance intention and actual use dimension are often self-reported (Abramson et al. 2015; Esteban-Millat et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2010; Nistor 2014; Straub et al. 1995) . Although the TAM authors caution that such indicators \"should not be regarded as precise measures\" (Davis et al. 1989, p. 991) , this is nonetheless problematic as self-reported measures of intent are known to be unreliable in relation to actual behavior (Morwitz 2014) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 130, "end": 155, "text": "(Ajzen and Fishbein 1980;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 156, "end": 180, "text": "Fishbein and Ajzen 1975)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 312, "end": 337, "text": "(Agarwal and Prasad 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 399, "end": 411, "text": "(Davis 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 762, "end": 779, "text": "King and He 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 780, "end": 806, "text": "Mortenson and Vidgen 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 807, "end": 833, "text": "Schepers and Wetzels 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 834, "end": 854, "text": "Scherer et al. 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 855, "end": 887, "text": "Weerasinghe and Hindagolla 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF122"}, {"start": 1118, "end": 1140, "text": "(Abramson et al. 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1141, "end": 1168, "text": "Esteban-Millat et al. 2018;", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1169, "end": 1185, "text": "Liu et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 1186, "end": 1198, "text": "Nistor 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 1199, "end": 1218, "text": "Straub et al. 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 1320, "end": 1347, "text": "(Davis et al. 1989, p. 991)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1476, "end": 1490, "text": "(Morwitz 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Informed by the educational conditions being shaped by the novel coronavirus pandemic and an increased reliance on online learning solutions and technologies, this article examines the role of personality traits and online academic self-efficacy on the acceptance, actual use and achievement in Moodle within a compulsory 15-week socially distanced asynchronous university course in Japan. The current study contributes to the literature in three main areas. First, it adds to the small number of studies which link personality traits to the TAM (Svendsen et al. 2013) . Second, the lack of Japan-based research identified by Granic and Marangunic (2019) and Murillo et al.

Finally, when technology use is compulsory such as it is within the current study, assessments of intent to use become somewhat redundant as course achievement is heavily dependent upon system use regardless of attitude.

In the original conceptualization, the use of a system was drawn parallel to the theoretical principles of the TRA (Ajzen and Fishbein 1980; Fishbein and Ajzen 1975) in that motivations could be explained relative to the perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and attitude (Davis 1986) (Fig. 1) . The later TAM2 (Venkatesh and Davis 2000) extended the original model to explain perceived usefulness and usage intentions relative to social influence (subjective norm, voluntariness and image), and cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output quality and result demonstrability). The TAM and the TAM2 regularly account for between 40%-60% of technology acceptance variance among users (Park 2009 ). Within the TAM a perceived ease of use is defined as \"the degree to which the prospective user expects the target system to be free of effort\" whereas perceived usefulness refers to \"the prospective user's subjective probability that using a specific application will increase his or her job performance within an organizational context\" (Davis et al. 1989, p. 985) . The perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness components reflect cognitive responses to using technology which then influence an affective response through (Holden and Rada 2011) . While the relationships between the variables have been described as robust (Legris et al. 2003; Venkatesh and Davis 2000) certain studies have challenged the significance of the relationship between perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness (Venkatesh 2000) , the relationship between perceived ease of use and attitude (Park 2009; Saade et al. 2007 ) and between perceived ease of use and frequency of use (Adams et al. 1992) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 137, "end": 164, "text": "(Davis et al. 1989, p. 985)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 334, "end": 359, "text": "(Ajzen and Fishbein 1980;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 360, "end": 384, "text": "Fishbein and Ajzen 1975)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 497, "end": 509, "text": "(Davis 1986)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 536, "end": 562, "text": "(Venkatesh and Davis 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 919, "end": 929, "text": "(Park 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 1271, "end": 1298, "text": "(Davis et al. 1989, p. 985)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1462, "end": 1484, "text": "(Holden and Rada 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1563, "end": 1583, "text": "(Legris et al. 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1584, "end": 1609, "text": "Venkatesh and Davis 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 1734, "end": 1750, "text": "(Venkatesh 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 1813, "end": 1824, "text": "(Park 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 1825, "end": 1842, "text": "Saade et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 1900, "end": 1919, "text": "(Adams et al. 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 510, "end": 518, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Technology acceptance model"}, {"text": "The TAM has been applied to a range of systems including mobile gaming (Ha et al. 2007) , advertisements in social media (Lin and Kim 2016) and driverless vehicles (Koul and Eydgahi 2018) .

The first TAM studies concerning Moodle were in 2009 since which time research interest has grown with a peak in 2019 (Murillo et al. 2020) . TAM studies have been drawn from diverse educational contexts. In a Spanish university Sanchez and Hueros (2010) found that Moodle usage was directly influenced by a perceived ease of use and attitude. Similarly, Escobar-Rodriguez and Monge-Lozano (2012) found that the perception of Moodle as being easy to use had a positive effect on the continuance intention. At a Slovenian university Sumak et al. (2011) report that perceived usefulness was the strongest predictor of attitudes toward using Moodle and that Moodle use was dependent on behavioral intentions and attitudes. The authors state that \"students like to use Moodle if they have good feelings about the usefulness of Moodle in getting better grades and knowledge\" (p. 98). In universities in Serbia, Lithuania, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, Damnjanovic et al. (2015) drew from the attitudinal component of TAM to affirm that \"if students have a positive view of Moodle, they will intend to use it in the future\" (p. 508). At a Ghanaian university Essel and Apeanti (2017) found that perceived usefulness was the primary indicator of Moodle use. More recently, Huang et al. (2017) used the TAM to model Moodle acceptance intentions among university students in Macau and found that \"students were inclined to use Moodle when they perceived or were convinced that it was a robust, innovative, easy, and useful platform\" (p. 761).

Early personality research focused on the reporting of arbitrary lists of traits believed to contribute to the individual although this was replaced with an interest in the Fig. 1 The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) development of fixed-factor solutions. Within mainstream personality literature, five superordinate constructs representing a five-factor model (Costa and McCrae 1985; Digman 1990 ) have dominated the research landscape. The five-factor model of personality is widely acknowledged as \"a robust and comprehensive taxonomy of individual differences in personality' (Olesen et al. 2010, p. 538) and \"the most widely used and empirically supported model of normal personality traits\" (Chmielewski and Morgan 2013, p. 803) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 274, "end": 302, "text": "(Caprara et al. 2011, p. 79)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 460, "end": 478, "text": "Costa 1990, p. 29)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 592, "end": 620, "text": "(Bergold and Steinmayr 2018;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 621, "end": 643, "text": "De Feyter et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 644, "end": 673, "text": "Kappe and Van der Flier 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1125, "end": 1148, "text": "(Costa and McCrae 1985;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1149, "end": 1160, "text": "Digman 1990", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1344, "end": 1372, "text": "(Olesen et al. 2010, p. 538)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1461, "end": 1498, "text": "(Chmielewski and Morgan 2013, p. 803)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 936, "end": 942, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Personality traits, self-efficacy and achievement"}, {"text": "In contrast to personality traits, self-efficacy beliefs relate to an individual's \"confidence in their ability to organize and execute a given course of action to solve a problem or accomplish a task\" (Eccles and Wigfield 2002, p. 110) .

This corresponds to the view that self-efficacy is situational rather than a stable trait. In other words, whereas personality traits are somewhat unconditional behavioral tendencies, selfefficacy beliefs are context dependent knowledge structures that reference the ability to learn from experience and reflection (Caprara et al. 2011) . A number of TAM studies have positioned self-efficacy beliefs as an external variable (Holden and Rada 2011) although a greater number of studies have focused on computer self-efficacy (Park 2009; Sanchez and Hueros 2010; Yeou 2016) .

The personality traits used are extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness to experience (Goldberg 1993; John and Srivastava 1999) . Extraversion represents a tendency to be energetic, sociable, lively, assertive and to experience positive thoughts and emotions. Extraverted individuals are inherently social and outgoing and are therefore more likely to be self-confident and assured. The links between extraversion and academic achievement have been mixed with positive, negative and insignificant results being commonplace.

Conscientious individuals have an intrinsic motivation for achievement and an ability to selfdiscipline through persistent goal-orientated action (Costa et al. 1991; Poropat 2009 ). Kappe and van der Flier (2012) frame conscientiousness as the most consistent predictor of academic achievement. Conscientiousness correlates with higher levels of self-efficacy beliefs (Lee and Klein 2002) and more effective learning styles (Duff et al. 2004) . Conscientious students are aware of what is needed to achieve success (Bidjerano and Yun Dai 2007; Komarraju et al. 2009 ). As conscientious individuals tend to have fixed achievement goals, changes in circumstance are unlikely to detract from their ability and desire to work efficiently toward the achievement of goals. Socially distanced online learning is anticipated to provide conscientious students with a clear pathway toward achievement and success. Neuroticism indicates the predisposition to experience psychological distress in the form of negative emotions and the negative framing of experience (McCrae and Costa 2008) . While some studies have found negative connections between neuroticism and academic performance most studies report non-significant findings (Martin et al. 2006) . It is believed that neuroticism is unable to predict academic achievement over cognitive ability (Ridgell and Lounsbury 2004) . Emotional Stability (reverse neuroticism) refers to individuals who are stable and well-adjusted as opposed to anxious, self-conscious, tense and prone to the influence of negative emotions. Low emotional stability is disruptive to task performance and directly impacts beliefs concerning behavior and motivation.

The outcomes reported are therefore relevant to a wide range of educators and technologists interested in the dynamics of human-computer interactions. The primary findings reported concern the role of personality traits in the acceptance and use of technology. It has been shown that agreeableness and conscientious are the two most dominant traits in terms of their direct and indirect effect on the modelled interactions. The two traits had direct positive effects on online academic self-efficacy beliefs in addition to indirect positive effects on the perceived ease of use, the perceived usefulness, attitudes toward Moodle and online course achievement outcomes. It was earlier stated how agreeableness concerns the control of frustration meaning that agreeable students are perhaps less inclined to raise objection relating to their study environment. Previous studies have shown how such students are reliable attenders, cooperative (Lounsbury et al. 2003) and compliant with teacher instructions (Vermetten et al. 2001) . The finding that agreeableness had an indirect effect on online course achievement is a finding not previously reported. It may be that the relative isolation from others provides agreeable students with a more harmonious and less competitive learning environment in which they are able to function more effectively. It can be suggested that agreeableness combined with higher The stronger effect of conscientiousness on the aforementioned variables points toward its dominant position as the the most consistent predictor of academic achievement (Kappe and Van der Flier 2012) and as a trait which correlates with higher levels of self-efficacy beliefs (Lee and Klein 2002) and more effective learning styles (Duff et al. 2004 ). Within the current online learning environment there is significant emphasis placed on the need for effective self-regulation (Jansen et al. 2019) . Pintrich (2000) defines self-regulated learning as \"an active, constructive process whereby learners set goals for their learning and then attempt to monitor, regulate, and control their cognition, motivation, and behaviour, guided and constrained by their goals and the contextual features in the environment\" (p. 453). Conscientious students can be expected to have the capacity to identify personal goals and use them as a motivational standard through which study related actions and decisions are referenced and controlled (Zimmerman 2000) . Practical aspects of self-regulated learning such as strategic planning, time management and effort regulation are important for academic achievement (Puzziferro 2008 ) and would seem more important within the context of a compulsory socially distanced online learning environment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1064, "end": 1087, "text": "(Lounsbury et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 1128, "end": 1151, "text": "(Vermetten et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 1808, "end": 1828, "text": "(Lee and Klein 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 1864, "end": 1881, "text": "(Duff et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2011, "end": 2031, "text": "(Jansen et al. 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2034, "end": 2049, "text": "Pintrich (2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 2562, "end": 2578, "text": "(Zimmerman 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 2731, "end": 2747, "text": "(Puzziferro 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The role of extraversion draws attention to the specific behavioral demands of learning online as opposed to within the face-to-face classroom. Extraversion represents a tendency to be energetic, sociable, lively, assertive and to experience positive thoughts and emotions. Within face-to-face learning situations, especially those which demands open interactions and exchanges through the sharing of opinions with teachers and peers, extraverted students are at a natural advantage due to being inherently social and outgoing. While these traits do not always lead to greater achievement outcomes on account of the observation that the same extraverted individuals are likely to place social needs above academic ones, the socially distanced online learning environment would appear to place such students at a disadvantage. These students \"are left with fewer cues indicating that they are involved in a learning community and may instead view themselves as isolated\" (Johnson et al. 2008 ). This view is highlighted within the re-tested model where extraversion has a direct negative effect on course achievement. While Japanese nationals have some of the highest ratings of neuroticism in the world (Lynn and Martin 1995) , the current study provides support to the non-significant link between emotional stability and academic achievement (Martin et al. 2006) . In contrast, the non-significant effect of openness throughout the tested model is not consistent with the literature that marks openness as a significant correlate of academic achievement (Asendorpf and Van Aken 2003) .The effect patterns demonstrated by agreeableness and conscientious are generally replicated by online academic self-efficacy. This affirms the relationship between personality and self-efficacy as well as pointing toward an area in which educators can tailor their efforts in relation to the promotion of learning skills and greater self-regulated learning capabilities. These observations are given greater significance when noting that online academic self-efficacy beliefs had an indirect impact on course achievement larger than agreeableness and conscientious. Online academic self-efficacy can also be a reliable indicator of technology acceptance although as was found with personality, it cannot be viewed as a reliable indicator of actual Moodle use.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 970, "end": 990, "text": "(Johnson et al. 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1203, "end": 1225, "text": "(Lynn and Martin 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 1344, "end": 1364, "text": "(Martin et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 1556, "end": 1585, "text": "(Asendorpf and Van Aken 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In terms of the primary variables within the TAM several interesting observations can be made. While online academic self-efficacy was an almost equal indicator of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, these two variables held strikingly different effects on attitudes toward Moodle. The perceived ease of use was a nonsignificant indicator whereas the perceived usefulness of Moodle had a strong positive effect on attitudes. The non-significant effect of perceived ease of use on attitude reflects previous findings (Lee et al. 2005; Park 2009; Saade et al. 2007 ).While much of this can be attributed to the compulsory nature of course (i.e. it is useful as the only means by which students can achieve), Adams et al. (1992) suggest that perceived ease of use might be \"an important determinant of adoption but is less important in explaining the level of post-adoption usage\" (p. 243). The students in the current study were not new to Moodle and had some experience using the system prior to the novel coronavirus restrictions. Questions can also be asked concerning the validity of the affective attitudinal component of TAM as to whether a positive attitude toward Moodle is predominantly shaped by the perceived usefulness of the technology. The correlation matrix in Table 3 suggests that these two variables are not entirely independent of one another. Attitudes toward Moodle accounted for the largest portion of shared variance within the model, yet it had no significant effect on either actual Moodle use or course achievement. What then is the practical value of having a positive attitude toward Moodle if it does not inform actual usage or achievement when used as the exclusive means of learning? Previous studies have found that positive attitudes toward technology effect the continuance intention, but such findings must be questioned due to issues of self-report bias and reliability. It is difficult to conceive of a valid explanation as to why in the current context positive attitudes toward Moodle do not then transfer into actual usage behaviors or achievement. These questions take on further significance when noting that actual Moodle use was a strong significant indicator of course achievement. Identifying a reliable indicator of actual Moodle use represents an area for future research exploration.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 528, "end": 545, "text": "(Lee et al. 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 546, "end": 556, "text": "Park 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 557, "end": 574, "text": "Saade et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 718, "end": 737, "text": "Adams et al.

Rigorous quality management programs and continuous improvement are pivotal for online learning success and making people ready for any crisis-like situation\" (p. 18). The results discussed have implications for the provision of online education, particularly the socially distanced kind which have arisen in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic. In order to make such courses more inclusive to all individuals course creators and institutions need to identify how their programs can be more appealing for extraverted students through increasing the immediate social presence of others (Short et al. 1976 ) . Learner to learner interactions within online learning environments have been found as some of the most significant indicators of achievement (Macfadyen and Dawson 2012) as they promote learning via the intellectual stimulation and exchange of ideas (Agudo-Peregrina et al. 2014 ). Galikyan and Admiraal (2019) further report that \"social presence moderates the relationship between cognitive presence and student academic performance. This implies that instructional interventions that are aimed at promoting student participation and interaction as well as diversifying interaction and increasing response rates in online discussion forums are desired\" (p. 7). Asynchronous online discussion forums such as those commonplace in Moodle provide an outlet for such collaborative interactions to occur (Schrire 2006) . A lack of dynamic social interaction and the presence of fixed routines established within asynchronous online courses place extraverted students at a disadvantage. Moreover, the modes of assessment used within such courses (i.e. static forums, reports, readings, multiple choice quizzes etc.) should be orientated toward more creative real-time formats to allow for sociable, lively and outgoing individuals to use their innate traits toward greater achievement outcomes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 704, "end": 722, "text": "(Short et al. 1976", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 869, "end": 896, "text": "(Macfadyen and Dawson 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 977, "end": 1005, "text": "(Agudo-Peregrina et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1009, "end": 1037, "text": "Galikyan and Admiraal (2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1527, "end": 1541, "text": "(Schrire 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Practical considerations and concerns"}, {"text": "Similar concerns can be raised in relation to traits such as openness.

While the trait of conscientiousness underpins all productive study behaviors as reflected in its position as the dominant personality indicator of achievement, traits such as agreeableness appear to be favored within courses such as the one used in the current study. Johnson et al. (2008) cautions that \"e-learning success is not simply a matter of providing a rich set of technological opportunities, but instead technology must be seen as contributing to the learning success\" (p. 365). To this end, online learning specialists need to base their technological solutions and interests on well-researched pedagogical principles with sound theoretical rationale used to direct and moderate the use of technology. In contexts such as Japan there remains a tendency among some educators to view Moodle use as a learning outcome rather than as a tool for the communication and assessment of more comprehensive learning objectives. Moodle plugins that undermine responsibility and adaptive self-regulated learning skills are often promoted as technological pacifiers to maladaptive behaviors in the absence of efforts which guide students toward achievement related improvement (see Johnson et al. 2017 for a context specific example). Such tech-dominant approaches need to be eradicated and replaced with diversified online solutions which attract and sustain topical interest while maintaining pedagogical integrity through the promotion of adaptive selfregulatory behaviors.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 433, "end": 454, "text": "Johnson et al.

First, the participants within the current cannot be used to generalize beyond the immediate context which undermines the potential applicability of the results to other studies. Not only are cultural factors significant in shaping personality traits within the Japanese context but cultural etiquette also has a significant role on self-reported behaviors. Second, the TIPI is a practical measure of the five-factor model of personality and is not intended to possess the same psychometric properties as more extensive measures. While the TIPI has been validated in numerous studies it remains a substitute for the more traditional measures. Future studies that wish to focus on personality would therefore be advised to use more substantive measures although this creates additional issues with time demands, participation and drop-out rates. Murillo et al. (2020) state that \"there is scientific interest in understanding the acceptance and use of Moodle through the TAM model\" (p. 12). Given the educational conditions being shaped by the novel coronavirus pandemic and the increased reliance upon online learning solutions and technologies, this article has examined the effect of personality traits and online academic self-efficacy on the acceptance, actual use and course achievement in Moodle on a compulsory 15-week socially distanced asynchronous university course in Japan.
