Herein, we describe a case of nonmetastatic PPSRCC in a 45-year-old female. Presentation: A 45-year-old female presented with 3 weeks of abdominal pain radiating to her back. Other pertinent positives included a 20-pound (9.1-kilogram) weight loss and jaundice, with a known 30-pack-year smoking history. CT scan revealed a 4.6 \u00b7 3.6 cm hypoattenuating mass in the head of the pancreas (HOP) with dilatation of the common bile duct. Total bilirubin at presentation was elevated, and a biliary stent was placed endoscopically. Subsequent endoscopic ultrasonography revealed a periampullary ulcerated mass involving the HOP and second portion of the duodenum, with pathology revealing poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with mucinous background and focal signet ring cells. A classic pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) was performed. Final pathology revealed a poorly differentiated (G3) pT3/pN2/pM0 PPSRCC with 11 of 16 positive specimen lymph nodes. The tumor had evidence of both KRAS and TP53 mutations and expressed an MUC1+/MUC2-/MUC5AC+ immunophenotype. Medical oncology recommended a 6-month course of adjuvant modified-dose FOLFIRINOX therapy. Conclusion: This report highlights the need for further research into the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal signet ring cell carcinoma to identify and study therapeutic targets that can eventually be translated to PPSRCC treatment.

Given the relative high proportion of pancreatic cancers that are adenocarcinomas, many subtypes of pancreatic cancer generally draw on literature specifically related to the adenocarcinoma variant when guiding treatments. 4 Primary pancreatic signet ring cell carcinoma (PPSRCC) is a rare infrequently reported histopathological variant of pancreatic cancer with an estimated incidence of <1%. 5 The most recent 2019 World Health Organization classification system defines PPSRCC as a subtype of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. 6 Recent literature suggests that PPSRCC has a lower overall 5-year survival rate than pancreatic adenocarcinoma as a whole (4% vs. 9%) and is more likely to present with distant disease at the time of diagnosis (69.4% vs. 52%). 5 Owing to its low prevalence and reporting, treatment guidelines specific for PPSRCC do not exist in the literature, and treatment is guided by existing literature on pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

[11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] A recent study analyzing surveillance, epidemiology, and end results program (SEER) data found 497 cases of PPSRCC from 1973 to 2018. 5 Over 90% of signet ring cell carcinomas (SRCCs) are gastric cancers, and it is estimated that up to 28.2% of primary gastric cancers are in fact SRCCs. 5,21 Less commonly, SRCCs are found in the breast, gallbladder, bladder, and other locations within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, including the esophagus, colorectum, and pancreas. 21 Within the periampullary region, determining the origin of poorly differentiated malignancies can be difficult, and certain MUC staining techniques can aid in determining the origin. MUC staining was performed on our specimen, which revealed expression of MUC1/MUC5AC and lack of expression of MUC2/4/6. Such an expression pattern, particularly the MUC1+/MUC2-/MUC5AC+ immunophenotype, is characteristic of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Figs. 5 and 6). 22 Although these findings furthered the supposition that this tissue is pancreatic in origin, it should be noted that this immunophenotype may also be present in cholangiocarcinoma. 22 Although within the periampullary region, cancers of biliary origin are rarer than that of pancreatic origin, a cancer of biliary origin cannot be completely ruled out. 23 Pathologically, SRCC is a highly malignant form of adenocarcinoma that produces abundant amounts of MUC, which push the nucleus to the periphery and generate the characteristic phenotype of the ''signet ring'' cell (Fig. 5) . It is hypothesized that these cells originate from constitutive activation of the ErbB2/ErbB3 pathway, leading to unregulated activity of PI3K/MEK1 and downstream disruption of adherens junction proteins, notably E-Cadherin. 24 This loss of key cell-to-cell interactions has two primary effects in the development of SRCC: (1) formation of a desmoplastic stroma, which facilitates the creation of a tumor growth-enhancing microenvironment, and (2) the generation of the signet ring cell phenotype. It should be noted that the development of a desmoplastic stroma is not unique to SRCC and is in fact characteristic of many carcinomas. However, it is a subsequent mechanism that leads to the generation of the SRCC phenotype, notably constitutive Muc4/ErbB2 interaction. Muc4 is an integral membrane glycoprotein normally located on the basolateral surface of cells that functions to tether membranebound MUCs to the cell membrane. Owing to its location on the basolateral membrane, Muc4 is normally physically separated from the ErbB2 tyrosine kinase typically located on the cell's apical surface. Aberrant interaction of Muc4 with ErbB2 allows for unregulated MUC production and the generation of the signet ring cells. 24, 25 SRCC is histologically defined as >50% signet ring cells in the tumor pathological specimen. 26 The origin of SRCC in the HOP is not well elucidated and several proposed mechanisms exist within the literature. First, given that >90% of SRCCs are of gastric origin, it is suggested that these cancers stem from a heterotopic gastric mucosa nidus in the pancreatic region. 27 Indeed, there are reports of ectopic gastric mucosa in the periampullary region in SRCC. 28 Others suggest that these tumors in the pancreas originate from gastric-type metaplasia to the periampullary region that subsequently develops into a neoplastic pancreatic tumor. This theory stems from reports of gastric metaplasia found near the duodenal bulb of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) patients. It is suggested that increased acidity in the duodenal bulb in PUD patients leads to a metaplastic response in which gastric-type epithelium is protective. 26 The metaplastic response later spreads through the periampullary region to the pancreas, where it acquires neoplastic potential.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 149, "end": 153, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 154, "end": 158, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 159, "end": 163, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 164, "end": 168, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 169, "end": 173, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 174, "end": 178, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 179, "end": 183, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 184, "end": 188, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 189, "end": 193, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 194, "end": 198, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 671, "end": 673, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1124, "end": 1126, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1307, "end": 1309, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1479, "end": 1481, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1933, "end": 1935, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2930, "end": 2933, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2934, "end": 2936, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3030, "end": 3032, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3308, "end": 3310, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3400, "end": 3402, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3860, "end": 3862, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 137, "end": 146, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1697, "end": 1705, "text": "(Fig. 5)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "A recent study analyzing SEER data from 1973 to 2013 found 497 total cases of PPSRCC, 247 (49.7%) specifically in the HOP. 5 Compared with other forms of primary pancreatic cancer, this gives PPSRCC a prevalence of <1%. The most common form of pancreatic cancer is pancreatic adenocarcinoma (85.8% of pancreatic cancers); as such, it is useful to draw comparisons between PPSRCC and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. 3 PPSRCC was shown to have a 5-year overall survival (OS) of *4% (compared with 9% in pancreatic adenocarcinoma). PPSRCC was less likely to present as a localized disease than pancreatic adenocarcinoma (3.0% vs. 11%), and more likely to present with distant disease (69.4% vs. 52%). Distant disease at the time of presentation was shown to portend a 62.2% decrease in overall survival when compared with localized/regional tumors. The median ages of presentation for SRCCs appear to drastically vary based on the primary organ, ranging from 40 to 70 years old. In relation to the pancreas, PPSRCC had a median age of presentation of 68 years, slightly younger than the 70-year-old median age of presentation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. 5 No research to date has compared levels of blood tumor markers in PPSRCC, such as CA 19-9 and CEA, with other forms of pancreatic cancer.

Distant disease showed improved OS with pancreatectomy, pancreatectomy+EBRT, and EBRT alone. Indeed, studies in patients with metastatic disease from the breast, prostate, and kidney have shown that resection and radiotherapy can independently predict improved survival. [29] [30] [31] Unfortunately, SEER data do not currently report the use of concurrent chemotherapy. Given that chemotherapy and radiation therapy are often coadministered in the treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, it is suggested that the isolated improvement in OS of distant disease patients treated with EBRT alone could be at least partially due to contaminant use of chemotherapy. 5, 32 Moreover, it remains difficult to draw conclusions regarding PPSRCC treatment from this analysis given that therapies have considerably improved from 1973, the starting year for this particular cohort. The only stratified temporal analysis done with this cohort combined all localized, regional, and metastatic PPSRCC tumors from 2000 to 2013 and reported that all three treatment modalities (EBRT, pancreatectomy, and pancreatecto-my+EBRT) independently improved OS.
