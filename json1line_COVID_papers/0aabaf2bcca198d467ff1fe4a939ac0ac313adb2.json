Although it is possible for anyone to contract COVID-19, healthcare professionals (HPs) are more vulnerable as they are more exposed. 3 Members of this group face the same risks of exposure to potentially contagious individuals as the general population: social interactions and contact with the people with whom they live. However, they also face additional risks: 1) the risk deriving from providing healthcare to patients (symptomatic or asymptomatic), and 2) the risk deriving from going about their workday at a healthcare centre, which, being a closed institution, may act as an amplifier of transmissibility of infectious diseases that are spread through contact, droplets or the air (Fig. 1) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 436, "end": 437, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 993, "end": 1001, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Resumen:"}, {"text": "For this reason, ever since the first cases of COVID-19 were detected in China, its impact on HPs has been studied. Some studies have estimated that 9-16% of HPs have been affected. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Most reported data are derived from microbiological diagnosis using real-time polymerase J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f chain reaction (PCR) testing on respiratory samples from symptomatic individuals. Real-time PCR detects viral RNA before symptoms begin and for a variable period of time depending on disease severity. 9, 10 This technique yields false negative results when performed once the disease has already progressed, since it is known that negative PCR results increase as seropositivity rates increase. 11 Serology techniques can be used for retrospective diagnosis of cases and identification of asymptomatic cases. They detect specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and have demonstrated a growing sensitivity over the course of the infection, exceeding 90% in the second week following the onset of symptoms. 11 Measuring the impact on HPs is the first step towards ascertaining whether HPs have been infected with the same frequency as the rest of the population, and therefore determining whether the infection prevention and control (IPC) programmes implemented at healthcare centres have been effective. These are based on the virus's mechanism of transmission 12 , i.e. respiratory droplets when one is within a metre of an individual with symptomatic COVID-19. 13 Asymptomatic persons are also known to be capable of transmitting the virus. 14 Suitable IPC programmes, together with proper compliance with established recommendations, should render the risks of exposure faced by HPs equal to those faced by the general population.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 182, "end": 185, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 186, "end": 189, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 190, "end": 193, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 194, "end": 197, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 198, "end": 201, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 523, "end": 525, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 526, "end": 528, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 717, "end": 719, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1023, "end": 1025, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1481, "end": 1483, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Resumen:"}, {"text": "Following the publication of the preliminary report of the population-based seroepidemiology study for estimating the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Spain 15 , it is important to determine the impact on HPs by means of serology so that comparisons may be made.

According to official figures, the population on 1 January 2019 in the city of the HD was 334,887 inhabitants. 18 Hence, the estimated prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the HPs in the HD would not have been higher than that of the population of major cities. This comparison is limited by the fact that the HP sample lacked participants under 20 and over 70 years of age. To date, data corresponding to HPs in other HDs in the immediate surroundings that could be used for comparison are unknown. On a national level, another leading hospital in Barcelona found that 9.3% of HPs had developed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, although in this case positive results for IgG and also IgM and IgA were considered. 19 In Le\u00f3n (Spain), in primary care and nursing home settings, a true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection of 4.9-11.0% was found, considering positive results for IgG or IgM by means of a rapid differentiation test (RDT), using a whole blood sample from a finger stick. 20 As regards age distribution, this study found no statistically significant differences in the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among the different age groups. Moreover, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f comparison of the prevalence of antibodies in the different age subgroups in this study to that in the same age subgroups in the National Seroepidemiology Study of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Spain 15 reveals that the prevalence is similar among those 45-64 years of age. However, differences were seen in other age groups: in HPs in the HD under 44 years of age, the prevalence of antibodies was higher than that estimated in the general population, where prevalences from 3.9% (in the 30-34 age group) to 4.9% (in the 25-29 age group) were obtained. It is also striking that the group of physicians was the one that presented a higher prevalence of antibodies, with a frequency of 8.7%. This occupation is not, a priori, the one that is most exposed to procedures associated with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, which are those that generate aerosols: aspiration of secretions, administration of nebulised treatment, non-invasive ventilation with positive pressure, etc. 3 . This would suggest that perhaps there are settings in which exposure occurs other than patient care per se, such as working in a closed institution or having to interact with other HPs in the course of their professional activities (Fig. 1) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 401, "end": 403, "text": "15", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 696, "end": 698, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1305, "end": 1307, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1574, "end": 1576, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2764, "end": 2765, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3000, "end": 3008, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The figures for impact on HPs invite reflection on how IPC programmes can contribute to reducing the risk of transmission at healthcare centres. As a result of the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO urged governments to make controlling the disease an utmost priority 21 with social distancing measures in order to minimise contact between people. Such measures in Spain were strict; several levels of distancing were implemented simultaneously with the declaration of a state of alarm on 14 March 2020 22 and a lockdown was introduced, with people ordered to remain at home, workplaces and educational centres were closed, and so on. These radical measures with targeted compliance had a direct impact on social interactions ( Fig. 1 ) and, therefore, on slowing the spread of the virus. 23 However, the above measures had no bearing on specific additional risks faced by HPs resulting from interactions occurring in a closed institution and in caring for patients. Therefore, IPC programmes specifically aimed at infections associated with healthcare at healthcare centres should be a priority for protecting the health of HPs and patients. In the case of this HD, considering that the disease is transmitted by droplets and taking international recommendations into account 3,24 , the following strategies were established before the start of the epidemic: 1) respiratory hygiene measures aimed at patients with respiratory symptoms, including the recommendation to use a surgical mask (provided by the centre); and 2) application of expanded droplet, contact and eye protection precautions for the care of patients who present symptoms consistent with COVID-19, which require using personal protective equipment (gown, gloves, surgical or FFP2/FFP3 mask and face shield or protective goggles). 12 These two strategies with measurable compliance directly contribute to the decrease in the risk of exposure to patients with symptoms but do not protect against exposure to asymptomatic patients or other HPs who could potentially be infected. With the goal of protecting HPs against these risks, on 19 March 2020, a decision was made to establish the following measure: 3) the recommendation that healthcare staff use a surgical mask as long as they are less than one metre from a patient or other individual (in the care of asymptomatic patients, in all other workplace activities, in their shared home environment and in their social lives).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 280, "end": 282, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 515, "end": 517, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 801, "end": 803, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 740, "end": 746, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "It is worth noting that the effectiveness of these measures depends directly on compliance with them. It was possible to determine by means of (informal) observation that compliance with the use of a surgical mask by HPs in the course of the workday during patient care exceeded 90%. This measure would have a high impact as it would protect HPs caring for asymptomatic patients. Such patients represent a risk for HPs, who may not clinically suspect COVID-19 and therefore they may not adopt suitable protective measures. However, compliance in domestic and social settings and in occupational settings outside of patient care were unknown. Hence, the impact on these risks may have varied widely. This measure was subsequently evaluated at the centre and it was concluded that it had been effective. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in HPs dropped from 22.1 per 1,000 workers in the pre-exposure period to 8.0 per 1,000 workers in the exposure period. 25 Data from other studies have also supported using a mask when interacting with other members of an individual's household 26 , which is essential if attempting to reduce risks across all settings. Lower compliance with this recommendation in those belonging to younger age groups, who tend to engage in more social interactions, could explain why there was a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in said age groups, though it is true that this hypothesis could not be tested.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 958, "end": 960, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1083, "end": 1085, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Notable among the limitations of this study is a possible selection bias stemming from nonparticipation by 12.9% of HPs. However, this might be disregarded because the absence of statistically significant differences in the distribution by sex, age and occupation between participants and non-participants was verified. In addition, no information was collected on the presence of symptoms, possible contact with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19, settings in which such contact took place, etc., which would have made it possible to establish the potential origin of risky contact moments that could have led to infection. Another possible limitation is underdiagnosis deriving from false negative results, although it is true that the sensitivity and specificity of the techniques used exceed 90%, according to the manufacturers. In addition, it should be noted that the diagnostic validity of the ELISA technique (used in this study) is superior to immunofluorescence techniques (which were the basis of the provisional data from the national seroepidemiology study). Finally, there is no seroepidemiology study in the general population in the area of the HD with the same structure by sex and age as the HPs, and so the effectiveness of IPC programmes against the additional risks to which HPs are exposed could not be evaluated more precisely.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The impact of COVID-19 on HPs in the HD is equal to its impact on the general population in major cities. This gives an idea of the effectiveness of the IPC programme aimed at HPs in this HD. Equalisation of the risks to which HPs are exposed and the risks to which the rest of the population is exposed largely depends on the recommendations established in the IPC programmes implemented and on the degree of compliance with them. Thus, there is an urgent need to support research studies aimed at controlling the pandemic through non-pharmacologic measures and, in particular, measures focused on infection prevention and control in healthcare settings.
