Each province or territory has a designated agency, such as Alberta Gaming, Liquor, and Cannabis or the Ontario Cannabis Store, that reports the jurisdiction's recreational sales to Health Canada, in both dollars and product volume terms, within 15 days of the end of each month. However, few of these data are currently made public. Health Canada posts national total sales volumes for both recreational and medical products on its website (https://www.canada.ca/en/ health-canada/services/drugs-medication/cannabis/research -data/market.html), but only the medical volumes are broken down by province and territory.

For a 2020 research article that used government data to estimate monthly recreational sales in dollars per capita, grams per user and percentage share of kilograms or litres consumed, 4 Health Canada could not release provincial breakdowns without provincial permission, and only 2 provinces subsequently shared their monthly data. Journalists' requests for data are also often rebuffed. For example, Alberta's chief medical officer suggested in July 2020 that cannabis use might have increased during lockdowns put in place because of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. While Alberta's monthly sales numbers could have shed light on that hypothesis, Alberta Gaming, Liquor, and Cannabis refused to release them (www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/ alberta-health-liquor -cannabis-sales-no-actual-data-1.5612664).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 316, "end": 317, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "This provincial secrecy contrasts starkly with the proactive disclosure practised by several states in the US.

Furthermore, Washington allows researchers to analyze its (anonymized) sales databases that contain millions of retail and wholesale transactions. 7 Making data available to such a level of detail enables better assessments of the impacts of legalization. 8 Consider the basic regulatory question of how many cannabis stores to allow. Too few stores might mean users remain with illegal dealers, whereas too many shops might encourage greater usage.

The extent to which legalization may reduce physical harms to users or law enforcement harms to minorities, partly depends on how many existing users start buying products through regulated channels.
