Oxygen administration is crucial in COVID-19 treatment and, unlike conventional oxygen therapy, high-flow nasal cannulas (HFNCs) prevent the need for intubation in patients with acute respiratory failure [1, 2] . However, HFNC use is limited owing to concerns of aerosol generation.

HFNC is implemented when oxygenation cannot be maintained by an oxygen mask (with reservoir bag). Our institution currently lacks a clear protocol for HFNC initiation; instead, its use depends on clinical physician judgment. We adopted the F & P 850 system (Fisher & Paykel Healthcare) for HFNC therapy with a temperature setting of 37.0 C and absolute humidity of 44 mg/L. The flow rate and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) were adjusted according to individual clinical physician preferences. We classified patients administered HFNC therapy due to condition deterioration as HFNC success or failure, depending on whether intubation could be avoided. Patients who died without intubation due to do-not-attemptresuscitation (DNAR) orders were classified as HFNC failure.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Fifteen patients (88.2%) required HFNC due to deterioration with a median time-to-HFNC of 10 days after symptom onset.

Baseline treatment was determined by each department and included remdesivir, (9 patients, 60%), hydroxychloroquine (3 patients, 23%), favipiravir (2 patients, 13.3%), lopinavirritonavir (1 patient, 6.7%), and corticosteroid (14 patients, 93.3%) ( Table 1) . Regarding baseline vital signs, the median saturation of percutaneous oxygen (SpO 2 )/FiO 2 was lower in the HFNC failure group than that in the HFNC success group ( Table 2 ).
