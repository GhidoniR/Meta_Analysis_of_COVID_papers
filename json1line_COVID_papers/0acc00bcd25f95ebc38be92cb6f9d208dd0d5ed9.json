In Fig. 2A we plot\u03bb c as a function of \u03ba for all the cities in our dataset, represented as filled circles colored according to their respective countries. We find a universal trend, whereby all cities fall into a curve marking an inverse relationship between the vulnerability of the cities and the extent to which flows are concentrated between hotspots, i.e\u03bb c \u223c \u03ba \u03b2 with \u03b2 \u2248 \u22120.25.

Conversely, in those cities where the population moves primarily between hotspots, there is little-to-no difference in risk in terms of whether residents stay in their patches, or whether they move to different ones. In Fig. S1 , we show the equivalent of Fig To further characterize the relation existing between cities' vulnerability and the concentration of mobility between density hotspots, we next analyze the impact of reshuffling the flows at a local scale for each of the analyzed cities.

As the figure indicates for the vast majority of cities (irrespective of their original value of \u03ba), the effect of switching off the flows between hotspots leads to an increase in the epidemic threshold, in turn lowering their vulnerability to epidemic spread. In particular there appears to be three categories of cities: beneficial, those where the threshold is increased greater than 10%; neutral, those where the threshold is increased by less than 10%; and finally detrimental, those where the threshold is instead lowered.

The strategy we pursue is to modify flows between different types of locations in the city without the need to isolate individuals at home. The different schemes are illustrated in the upper panel of Fig. 4 . In the first intervention (Intervention I), an asymmetrical strategy involves restricting flows from non-hotspot (heretofore referred to as suburbs) towards hotspot areas and converting them to self-loops, while keeping all other flows the same. Intervention II corresponds to the reverse situation where flows from hotspots to suburbs are converted to self-loops.

Removing this route makes the situation significantly worse. Finally, panel C reveals that limiting the mobility between hotspots has a mostly neutral effect, although the trends are noisier given that its effectiveness is closely related to the underlying population density distribution inside hotspots. The results suggest that, among the scenarios outlined, the most beneficial policy is to restrict residents in suburbs from visiting hotspots, while at the same time allowing residents in hotspots to continue with their regular mobility behavior.

Among these aspects, human mobility is a key factor underlying the unfolding patterns of epidemic outbreaks. Understanding how human mobility shapes the spatiotemporal unfolding of contagious diseases is essential for the design of efficient containment policies to ameliorate their impact. In this paper, we investigate the interplay between the population density and the spatial distribution of flows in urban areas, and its impact on determining exposure to epidemic outbreaks. We report a clear trend worldwide: the existence of a high volume of individuals commuting among the population density centers of a given city makes it more vulnerable to the spread of epidemics. The extent of a city's vulnerability as determined from our formalism, allows us to shed light on a real epidemic scenario: the spread of SARS-COV-2 across United States.

It is precisely the lack of anticipation to the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, that has led countries to enforce aggressive containment measures aimed at ameliorating the impact of the disease. The predominant strategy has been the implementation of lockdown policies, forcing a large fraction of the population to stay isolated at home, thus reducing considerably their number of interactions.

In this scenario, suburbs would also have the potential to develop large outbreaks so the existence of infection routes across the city would lead to an acceleration of the propagation of the epidemic front.

The threshold for hotspots is assigned by applying a non-parametric method, the LouBar method [46, 47], based on the derivative of the Lorenz curve. The Lorenz curve is the sorted cumulative distribution of population densities and is obtained by plotting, in ascending order, the normalized cumulative number of nodes vs. the normalized cumulative population density. The threshold is then obtained by taking the derivative of the Lorenz curve at (1, 1) and extrapolating it to the point at which it intersects the x-axis.
