Normal distribution of the variables was tested with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The variables normally distributed were compared by t test and 1-way ANOVA; otherwise the Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used. Categorical variables were summarized in terms of numbers and percentages and were compared by using the two-sided Fisher's exact test. To model continuous response variable represented by serial measurements over time within subject we set up a linear mixed effect model taking into account for correlations between measurements on the same subject to have optimal model fits and honest inference. Parameter estimation was performed by restricted maximum likelihood, random intercept with fixed mean.

These alterations were associated with changes in inflammation, coagulation and endothelial function and no different response was generally observed across causative micro-organisms [14] . The infection by SARS-CoV-2 appears to confirm this paradigm. Preliminary studies showed that patients with COVID-19 have an altered and heightened platelet activation compared to healthy subjects [4, [6] [7] [8] . It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 and its Spike protein directly stimulated platelets to facilitate the release of coagulation factors, the secretion of inflammatory factors, and the formation of leukocyte-platelet aggregates [15] . Our study confirms the finding that COVID-19 is associated with modification in platelet activation and aggregation. However, these alterations are not specific for COVID-19 patients and are also observed in patients admitted with respiratory failure due to causes other than SARS-CoV-2 infection. The exception is in the values of sCD40L, which is significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients. Previous studies suggested that alterations in platelet aggregation of COVID-19 patients are correlated to the severity of illness [4, [6] [7] [8] . Critically ill COVID-19 patients showed higher circulating values of several inflammation and thrombosis markers, including P-selectin and sCD40L [4, [6] [7] [8] . Regarding platelet aggregation values, we did not find differences between ICU vs. non-ICU COVID-19 patients. However, it should be noted that COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU differed from others in several baseline characteristics (age, sex, BMI, medical history, laboratory data). All these parameters significantly affect the platelet aggregation [16] . Thus, it is not surprising that after correction for confounding factors the differences between ICU and non-ICU COVID-19 patients were not confirmed. On the contrary, P-selectin and sCD40L values were influenced by COVID-19 severity, being heightened in ICU patients. This finding is consistent with previous studies and it could be explained by the fact that P-selectin and sCD40L are not platelet-specific markers but can be released by other cells (i.e. endothelial cells). The CD40-CD40 ligand system is widely distributed on leukocytic and non-leukocytic cells, including endothelial and smoothmuscle cells, and on activated platelets [17] . The sCD40L is proinflammatory for endothelial cells and promotes coagulation by inducing expression of tissue factor on monocytes [17] . The sCD40L is actively released after platelet stimulation, it interacts with the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor, and it is necessary for the stability of arterial thrombi [17] . P-selectin functions as cell adhesion molecule on the surfaces of activated endothelial cells and platelets [17] . During inflammation, P-selectin moves from an internal cell location to surfaces mediating recruitment of leukocytes and platelet aggregation [18] . Accordingly, the possible explanation for the higher P-selectin and sCD40L observed values could be outside from platelet-specific mechanisms. We can hypothesize that platelets act as amplifiers in the COVID-19 inflammatory burden [8] . This could be further supported by the observed over time reduction of sCD40L and P-selectin levels from T1 to T3. Alternatively, the higher values could be explained by a stronger involvement of the endothelium in the COVID-19 disease [4, 5, 15] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 132, "end": 136, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 137, "end": 140, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 141, "end": 144, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 330, "end": 334, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 534, "end": 537, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 538, "end": 541, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 542, "end": 545, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 546, "end": 549, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 778, "end": 782, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1310, "end": 1313, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1314, "end": 1317, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1318, "end": 1321, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1322, "end": 1325, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1474, "end": 1477, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1478, "end": 1481, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1482, "end": 1485, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1486, "end": 1489, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1844, "end": 1848, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2492, "end": 2496, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2629, "end": 2633, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2808, "end": 2812, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2923, "end": 2927, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3072, "end": 3076, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3310, "end": 3313, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3552, "end": 3555, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 3556, "end": 3558, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 3559, "end": 3562, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The major strength and novelty of our analysis is the association between heightened platelet activation and myocardial injury. This relationship is strong and consistent with all the biomarkers. From the first reports on COVID-19 patients, myocardial injury has been reported in around 20%-30% of cases, and it was associated with mortality [19] . The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying myocardial injury caused by COVID-19 are still under investigation. Hypotheses include direct damage to the cardiomyocytes, systemic inflammation, myocardial interstitial fibrosis, interferon mediated immune response, exaggerated cytokine response by Type 1 and 2 helper T cells, in addition to coronary plaque destabilization, and hypoxia. Autopsy studies suggested the presence of the viral genome in the myocardial tissue [20] . Particularly, viral infection seems to involve the endothelial compartment and may cause capillary endothelial cell/ microvascular dysfunction [4, 21] . Previous findings in patients with influenza pneumonia revealed that, during the initial phases, virus replication and dissemination is associated with platelet activation, generation of neutrophil-platelet aggregates, and fibrin/micro-thrombus formation [22, 23] . A similar pattern seems to be present in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. We may speculate that SARS-CoV-2 infection may induce endothelial injury and concomitant platelet activation leading to microthrombus formation and then myocardial injury. This proaggregating status contributes to the observed higher mortality. If confirmed, this hypothesis could have important clinical implications. Ongoing randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are trying to validate the safety and efficacy of higher doses of LMWH [NCT04373707, NCT04401293, NCT04372589]. Our data suggests that antiplatelet agents could be an intriguing alternative, especially in the early phase of infection. Supportive of this hypothesis is the finding that patients admitted to hospital with community-onset pneumonia who were established on chronic aspirin therapy showed lower mortality rates as compared to those who were aspirin-free [24] . The XANTHIPPE (Targeting Platelet-Leukocyte Aggregates in Pneumonia with Ticagrelor) study showed that ticagrelor reduced leukocytes with attached platelets as well as inflammatory biomarkers [25] . Tirofiban significantly improved the ventilation/perfusion ratio in 5 COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory failure [26] . Obviously, this hypothetical benefit should be balanced with the bleeding risk. The later phase of the most severe COVID-19 cases is associated with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, reduction in platelet count, depletion of coagulation factors, followed by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In these cases, the bleeding complications overwhelm the thrombotic complications and antiplatelet agents, as well as high dose of LMWH, can be counterproductive. Consequently, the results of ongoing clinical trials are eagerly awaited to answer this unmet clinical need [NCT04365309, NCT04410328, NCT04324463, NCT04409834].", "cite_spans": [{"start": 342, "end": 346, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 819, "end": 823, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 969, "end": 972, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 973, "end": 976, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1234, "end": 1238, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1239, "end": 1242, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2139, "end": 2143, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2338, "end": 2342, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2465, "end": 2469, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "This is a \"proof-of-concept\" hypothesis-generating study and several limitations should be considered.
