The hazards of dying in the tocilizumab group were 0.621 times of that in the control group. We reported 47.1% mortality in our first 70 patients of severe COVID-19 pneumonia with persistent hypoxia treated with tocilizumab till 5th June 2020, compared with 67% mortality in 90 controls (3 weeks prior to availability of tocilizumab) with persistent hypoxia due to severe COVID pneumonia [14] . At 3 weeks follow-up 11 / 151(15.7%) patients were still hospitalized. Two of them died later, increasing mortality to 50% in tocilizumab group. In a retrospective observational study in COVID 19 patients treated in ICU in New Jersey, Noa et al. [15] reported 49% mortality in 210 patients treated with tocilizumab and 61% mortality in 420 patients who did not receive tocilizumab. In present study, 60 out of our 151 patients from tocilizumab group were managed in COVID ICU. Due to non-availability of COVID ICU beds, 15 patients received non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in covid wards, and 7 patients received oxygen through high flow nasal canula (HFNC) in covid wards. Noninvasive ventilation was used in 56 patients from tocilizumab group (15 of them later required invasive ventilation) but in none from control group (it was avoided initially due to fear of aerosolization causing increased risk to health care workers). Overall, 30 patients required invasive ventilation (22 from tocilizumab group and 8 from control group. Many investigators, for example Kewan [9] , Nicola [8] have used early Tocilizumab in Covid 19 treatment. Nicola et al. [8] used tocilizumab in patients with peripheral Oxygen saturation 93% on room air or PaO2/FiO2 less than 300 mm of Hg, and documented reduction in mortality from 50 to 7.7%. With early use of tocilizumab, Nicola et al. [8] could reduce risk of death by 94%. Although more than 70% of our admitted patients were hypoxic (Oxygen saturation less than 95% on ambient air) during hospital stay, the limited availability of tocilizumab made it mandatory for us to formulate strict inclusion criteria for tocilizumab administration. These criteria were formulated by consensus of department members and [7] reported mortality in tocilizumab versus standard care group to be 7 and 20% respectively (P < .0001), with inclusion criteria being respiratory rate more than or equal to 30 per min, Oxygen saturation less than or equal to 93% on room air or PaO2/FiO2 ratio being 300 or less, and bilateral lung infiltrates more than 50% being present within 24 to 48 of admission. Average PaO2/ FiO2 ratio in their study was 169 in tocilizumab group as against 277 in standard care group. They also reported the effect of tocilizumab was at least two times higher in people with a baseline PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than 150 mmHg, implying that the benefit of tocilizumab could be greater in patients with a greater risk of death or mechanical ventilation [7] . Rossotti [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . In BACC (randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled) trial [19] , 16% patients did not require supplemental O2, 80% required less than 6 L per min O2. Though average saturation and PaO2/FiO2 ratio is not mentioned, over 90% patients had mild disease severity. The hazard ratio for intubation or death in the tocilizumab group as compared with the placebo group was 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38 to 1.81; P = 0.64). Authors have not ruled out possibility of some benefit or harm due to wide CI, though tocilizumab was not effective for preventing intubation or death. In the sample size calculations for this trial, the authors assumed an event rate for the primary outcome of 30% in the placebo group and 15% in the tocilizumab group. However, only 27 patients (11.2%) had a primary-outcome event (19 [7.8%] were intubated and 8 [3.3%] died without having been intubated. The event rate was lower than anticipated, which probably affected the interpretation of effect of treatment [24] .. In CORIMUNO-TOCI-19 (open label RCT) by Hermine et al. [20] , patients with PaO2/FiO2 200-300 were included, whereas those from ICU/ on HFNC/ NIV/MV (mechanical ventilator) were excluded, on day 14 12% reduction in need for MV or death was reported, but no reduction in death on day 28. In RCT-TCZ-COVID-19 by Salvarani et al. [21] included patients with PaO2/FiO2 200-300, average being 264, with average CRP 8.2(much less elevation as compared to our cohort with average CRP of 93.75), there was no benefit in achieving primary outcome (death/ MV/ PaO2:FiO2 < 150) with tocilizumab. In this study among the 17 patients reaching one primary endpoint (PaO2/FiO2 < 150) in the standard care group, 14 received tocilizumab as a rescue therapy (as per protocol). At 30 days, the incidence of intubation and death was comparable between the 2 groups. One can infer that the early administration of tocilizumab does not provide any significant advantage in reduction of intubation or mortality over a deferred administration at PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 150 mmHg. In COVACTA trial [22] (randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled), which reported no mortality benefits on 28 day with tocilizumab, eligibility criteria were broad, viz. patients with saturation less than 94% on room air, which also enrolled 37% patients on MV.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 604, "end": 608, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 857, "end": 861, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1681, "end": 1684, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1694, "end": 1697, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1763, "end": 1766, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1983, "end": 1986, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2360, "end": 2363, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3104, "end": 3107, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3110, "end": 3118, "text": "Rossotti", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3119, "end": 3123, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3124, "end": 3128, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3129, "end": 3133, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3134, "end": 3138, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3139, "end": 3143, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 3207, "end": 3211, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3956, "end": 3966, "text": "(19 [7.8%]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4140, "end": 4144, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 4203, "end": 4207, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 4475, "end": 4479, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 5224, "end": 5228, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Regarding EMPACTA [23] , it included patients with saturation less than 94% at room air.

C-reactive Protein improved by day 3 to 4. Amongst patients who received tocilizumab, D-dimer levels were higher in 'non-survived' group than in 'survived' group. Although this difference was not statistically significant, suspicion of terminal pulmonary thromboembolic event was high on clinical grounds in the non-survived group. Zhou et al. [2] reported Ddimer more than 1000 nanogram/ml to be a risk factor for mortality. BACC supplementary data [19] has reported that coagulation abnormalities probably did not improve with tocilizumab. Our clinical impression is that patients in whom clinical improvement in terms of reduced Oxygen requirement did not occur had either extensive lung involvement or high D-dimer or pulmonary thrombi on CT-Pulmonary angiography (imaging could not be performed in all patients due to logistics issues in patients on High Flow Nasal Canula or on non-invasive or mechanical ventilators). In 26 patients, HRCT chest could be performed, all had CO-RAD score [30] 6 (1 lowest to 6 highest suspicion) and average CT-severity score [31] was 21 out of 25. A study from Wuhan [32] reported maximum CT score higher than 11 was associated with development of severe illness. CT-pulmonary angiography was performed in 9 patients and documented pulmonary thrombi in 3 patients. CT-brain was performed in 3 patients and documented brain infracts in all.
