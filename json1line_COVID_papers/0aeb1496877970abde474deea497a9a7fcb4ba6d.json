Of note, patients with at least two comorbidities were approximately three-fold more likely to require hospitalization, and to die within 30 days from infection. However, this excess of risk disappeared after adjusting for age and gender, suggesting that it was due to patients being men and old, rather than to an inherent comorbidity independent effect. Interestingly, in our cancer cohort, two third of patients succumbing to COVID-19 were male with a median age of 74 years.

However, this finding is in line with the United Kingdom (UK) Coronavirus Cancer Monitoring Project (UKCCMP) [19, 20] , which recently reported that the diagnosis of lung cancer did not impact the risk of COVID-19 infection.

A study from China with 105 COVID-19 positive patients suggested that chemotherapy is associated with increased mortality [12] . However, this has been disputed by the UKCCMP suggesting that recent SACT regardless of treatment modality is not associated with worse outcomes in COVID-19 positive patients [20] . Our study showed that SACT is not a risk factor for 30-day mortality in cancer patients with COVID-19. Therefore, withholding or discontinuing SACT out of fear of COVID-19 might not be warranted. Furthermore, SACT appeared to reduce the risk of mortality in patients with metastatic disease, and this remained true even after adjusting for age and gender. It can be hypothesized that SACT, especially chemotherapy, may affect humoral and cellular immune function of treated cases, exerting some type of anti-inflammatory effect (reviewed in [25] ). However, patients receiving SACT did not suffer a less aggressive COVID-19 trajectory in our cohort, as they experienced similar rates of hospital and ICU admissions as patients not receiving any SACT (Table S2) . Additionally, metastatic patients not receiving SACT were more likely to have lung cancer and hematologic malignancies, and to present with worse performance status (Table S2) , which speak to their general frailty and possibly increased vulnerability to COVID-19.

Second, just 8% of hospitalized patients were admitted to ICU. In Italy, patients with COVID-19 are almost solely admitted to the ICU when mechanical ventilation is required, yet the rate of ICU admissions in our study was one third that reported in publicly available databases of COVID-19 positive cases [28] . Discussing treatment restrictions with cancer patients was a well-established practice even before COVID-19, especially for cases with incurable cancers. However, SACT has changed the life expectancy of patients with metastatic disease, and therefore the decision to use intensive care should be made in a multidisciplinary setting.

Second, the study could not estimate the prevalence and incidence of COVID-19 among cancer patients in the Lombardy region because it failed to capture most asymptomatic and/or mildly symptomatic cases not subject to testing. The optimal situation would have been to have a representative sample of the most common cancer types tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection to better understand COVID-19 epidemiology, but this was not possible at the height of the pandemic due to limited testing resources. Furthermore, the scientific community advised asymptomatic patients, including those with cancer, to seek medical care only if strictly necessary. We note, however, that no such data sets are yet available for any specific malignancy, as acknowledged also by a recently published Italian study addressing the incidence of COVID-19 among cancer patients [30] .

In the study population, we found a similar, if not numerically superior, mortality rate compared with other population-based datasets studying similar patient metrics. Known risk factors for mortality in COVID-19, including age and male gender, remain significant in this cancer patient population. Patients who received SACT do not have a worse prognosis regardless of disease stage. These findings suggest that postponing treatment for fear ofinfection between treatment cycles, appears unwarranted given SACT does not compromise prognosis once infection occurs. In contrast, metastatic patients receiving SACT had a reduced risk of mortality as compared with untreated counterparts. Large data sets are needed to validate our initial findings on the protective role of chemotherapy, and especially for patient management after the diagnosis of COVID-19, which remains yet to be defined. For now, during the COVID-19 pandemic, these vulnerable patients should avoid exposure or increase their protection to SARS-CoV-2 while treatment adjustments should be considered on valuebased prioritization and clinical cogency of interventions as recently recommended by international expert consensus [7] ; finally, in line with the WHO principles and objectives aiming to reduce deaths and disease burden, cancer patients deserve an additional priority for vaccination unless limitations exist [31, 32] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1337, "end": 1340, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1531, "end": 1535, "text": "[31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1536, "end": 1539, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Clinical characteristics of coro-navirus disease 2019 in China", "authors": [{"first": "W", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Guan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Z", "middle": ["Y"], "last": "Ni", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Y", "middle": [], "last": "Hu", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "W", "middle": ["H"], "last": "Liang", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": ["Q"], "last": "Ou", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["X"], "last": "He", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "L", "middle": [], "last": "Liu", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": [], "last": "Shan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Lei", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": ["S C"], "last": "Hui", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2020, "venue": "N.
