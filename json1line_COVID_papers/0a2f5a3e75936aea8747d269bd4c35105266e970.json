Cleavage of viral spike protein via the host cell's TMPRSS2 enzyme activity mediates viral entry into the host cell. The enzyme synthesis is regulated by the TMPRSS2 gene, which has also been implicated in the entry mechanisms of previously reported Coronavirus infections. In this review, we have investigated the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and disease susceptibility dependence on the TMPRSS2 gene as expressed in various population groups.

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) present in the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 is also similar to SARS-CoV, suggesting a mechanism of infection shared by both viruses. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the peptidase domain of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 abbreviated as the ACE2 of host cell before fusing and entering the host cell. 7 Moreover, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is also dependent on host protease TMPRSS 2 for its priming and entry into the host cells. 16 This protease has been shown to be crucial for SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease outcomes as cells expressing higher levels of TMPRSS2 yield higher SARS-CoV-2 cells have a higher viral damage. 17 In a short period of time, SARS-CoV-2 has virtually engulfed the whole world and caused high mortality. 5 The condition is further exacerbated as social and economic aspects of life around the globe have been heavily affected due to high infection rates and social distancing measures implemented in response to it. 18 These social distancing measures can slow down but cannot stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 unless a significant population of the world has contracted the virus. 19 In addition to the destruction caused by SARS-CoV-2, the nonavailability of viable drugs like antivirals against this new disease makes the condition challenging to deal with. 20 In the review, we have evaluated the role of TMPRSS2 protease in SARS-CoV-2 infection and how differences in respiratory expression of this protease can explain the associated discrepancy in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 outcomes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 46, "end": 47, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 259, "end": 261, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 418, "end": 421, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 422, "end": 424, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 614, "end": 616, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 765, "end": 767, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 896, "end": 898, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1115, "end": 1118, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1119, "end": 1121, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1569, "end": 1570, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1711, "end": 1713, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1906, "end": 1908, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2013, "end": 2014, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2225, "end": 2227, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2387, "end": 2389, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2566, "end": 2568, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Moreover, therapeutic interventions that are based on the inhibition and blocking of TMPRSS2 are also elucidated.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Coronaviruses (Coronaviridae family) belong to a group of positivesense single-stranded RNA viruses 21 that cause a variety of respiratory, nervous system, and enteric infections in various animal species including humans. 22 These viruses are subdivided at the level of the genus into four types called Alpha-(\u03b1), Beta-(\u03b2), Gamma-(\u03b3) and", "cite_spans": [{"start": 100, "end": 102, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 223, "end": 225, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| Mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection and role of TMPRSS2 protease"}, {"text": "Delta-(\u03b4) coronaviruses. 23 SARS-CoV-2 is a member of \u03b2coronaviruses, which have four lineages (A-D) with SARS-CoV as well as SARS-CoV-2 belonging to the B lineage, which contains roughly 200 sequenced viral genomes. 24 To be able to infect, a virus has to first bind to the host surface and subsequently initiate a complex entry mechanism. For coronaviruses in B-lineage, interaction with the host cell involves attachment of viral spike (S) protein with a specific host cell receptor 25 followed by protease-mediated cleavage of S-protein that allows viral entry into the host cells. 24 Both attachment and cleavage have been found to be crucial for lineage B \u03b2-coronaviruses to circumvent species-specific barriers and infect human cells. 24, 25 Structural analysis of the S-protein through cryogenic electron microscopy has revealed that it is a trimeric protein, with each -mer containing two functional subunits namely, S1 and S2. The S1 subunit is necessary for recognition of receptors on the surface of a susceptible host cell while the S2 subunit is responsible for fusion of the virus with the cell membrane of the host cell. The S1 subunit also contains an important region called RBD that helps S-protein in binding with ACE2. 26 The RBD domain contains all the information necessary for host receptor binding as well as folding independently from the rest of the viral S-protein. The distal S1 domain is cleaved when it binds with the hACE2 receptor. 27 TMPRSS2 is a serine protease that is vital for the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity because it causes proteolytic activation and intake of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells. It has been shown that a higher number of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles are isolated from the TMPRSS2 expressing cells than non-expressing cells. 28 Moreover, respiratory cells lacking TMPRSS2 protease are shown to have reduced lung pathology following SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. This has been demonstrated by infecting TMPRSS2 knockout and TMPRSS2 proficient mouse models (wild type or WT) with both coronaviruses. The WT batch of mice lost considerable body weight and had observable damaged lungs few days after being infected with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These symptoms were not observed, postinfection, in mutant mice. Moreover, as the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs results in lung damage followed by a local immune response characterized by the release of cytokines and chemokines, 29 immunological assays of these mutant mice also showed lower lung immunopathology and weakened cytokine and or chemokine mediated immune response as compared with the mutants. 17 This study provided interesting data, which, if proven for humans, could help explain the reasons for higher susceptibility of some population groups to show poor prognosis for COVID-19 compared with other less susceptible groups.

The highest level of expression of the gene is reported in the prostate region while lungs also have significantly high expression levels. 38 This high expression could be explained in terms of the fact that TMPRSS2 contains androgen-regulated elements (AREs) located upstream of transcription start site and first intron. 34 In androgen-regulated prostate cancer cells, TMPRSS2 is upregulated by androgen hormones while the opposite is true for androgenindependent prostate cancer cells.

One probable reason for higher infection rates among men could be increased exposure to SARS-CoV-2 as more males work outside than females. 99 Another possible explanation for the discrepancy in mortality rate could be the different levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression between males and females. Although a preprint study conducted on exome and SNP array sample data representing Italy's population found ACE2 to have no association with higher mortality rates among men, differences in expression of TMPRSS2 in bronchial epithelial cells found between males and females could explain severe COVID-19 outcomes in men. 94 In the study, males were found to express higher levels of Smoking as a contributing factor for higher TMPRSS2 expression in men", "cite_spans": [{"start": 159, "end": 162, "text": "96,", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 163, "end": 165, "text": "97", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 338, "end": 340, "text": "98", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 619, "end": 621, "text": "99", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 1099, "end": 1101, "text": "94", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| TMPRSS2 and gender as a susceptibility factor of SARS-CoV-2"}, {"text": "It is known that smoking increases TMPRSS2 expression and compared with women, men are more active smokers. 103, 104 It has been shown that smokers are 1.4 times more likely to be affected by severe COVID-19 outcomes and 2.4 times more prone to be admitted to ICU due to COVID-19 than non-smokers. 105 Analysis of lung expression data in publicly available expression database, that is, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) has revealed that smoking increases pulmonary TMPRSS2 expression significantly, however, interestingly, the expression returns to the nonsmoker level when smoking is stopped.

For such purposes, AR expression antagonists, AR coregulatory factors, and transcription factors such as ETS1 and SP1, and so on, could be used. 115 Apart from similarities in the TMPRSS2 gene role, the two diseases also share commonalities in risk factors that increase the likelihood of developing severe disease outcomes. Other risk factors of co-morbidity include alcoholism, diabetes, and hypertension; behavioral traits such as smoking and age >50 years. 116 Recently, it has been suggested that ADT used for prostate cancer patients could also be used in SARS-CoV-2 patients. 115 Compounds that are currently used as ADT include blockers of androgen receptors such as bicalutamide and enzalutamide, antigonadotropins and inhibitors of androgen synthesis. 117 ADTs such as estradiol, enzalutamide, genistein, and phytoestrogens have been shown to decrease expression of TMPRSS2 by 1.6-to 14-fold, depending on the cell lines and experimental conditions, and so on, used in these studies. On the other hand, androgen exposure has been found to increase TMPRSS2 expression by 1.4-to 20-fold. 108 Montopoli et al. 115 The study provides an important insight into the potential new treatment option for COVID-19 patients that if successful will help a significant population around the world. Androgens being involved in the regulation of TMPRSS2, are also implicated in severe immune reactions by increasing production of interleukins and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 while decreasing antibody production in response to viral infections. 118 The positive association between higher androgen levels and neutrophils produced can also be a cause of cytokine storm that can worsen COVD-19 related outcomes. 118, 119 Contrary to the hypothesis and observed association found by Montpoli et al., 115 using the androgen hormone antagonist enzalutamide did not result in a significant decrease of TMPRSS2 expression in the lungs of mice models. 106 93 When mice are given the same concentration of CM as required for humans, the mortality rate has been shown to be reduced by 70%-65%. 121 In Caco-2 and Vero cell lines, treatment with CM has shown partial inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the respective cell lines. However, when CM is used in combination with the CatB/L inhibitor called E-64d for the same cell lines, complete viral inhibition is attained, suggesting a combinational approach that acts synergistically in blocking SARS-CoV-2 entry completely. 50, 122 Another compound that is of interest for TMPRSS2 expression inhibition is Bromohexine. 123 The same compound has already been recommended for the treatment of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. 60 In the bronchial and pulmonary epithelial cells, the concentration of bromhexine can become four to six times higher than the in plasma, which is sufficient to suppress TMPRSS2 activity. 123 The compound is also being investigated for treatment of cough and chest congestion associated with pneumonia caused by COVID-19 in", "cite_spans": [{"start": 123, "end": 126, "text": "111", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 291, "end": 294, "text": "113", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 417, "end": 420, "text": "114", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}, {"start": 703, "end": 706, "text": "115", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}, {"start": 1019, "end": 1022, "text": "116", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 1141, "end": 1144, "text": "115", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}, {"start": 1320, "end": 1323, "text": "117", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 1654, "end": 1657, "text": "108", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 1675, "end": 1678, "text": "115", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}, {"start": 2099, "end": 2102, "text": "118", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 2264, "end": 2268, "text": "118,", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 2269, "end": 2272, "text": "119", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 2351, "end": 2354, "text": "115", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}, {"start": 2498, "end": 2501, "text": "106", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 2502, "end": 2504, "text": "93", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 2638, "end": 2641, "text": "121", "ref_id": "BIBREF122"}, {"start": 3018, "end": 3021, "text": "50,", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 3022, "end": 3025, "text": "122", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 3113, "end": 3116, "text": "123", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 3219, "end": 3221, "text": "60", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 3409, "end": 3412, "text": "123", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methodology GEO datasets used Result References"}, {"text": "China. 124 NCT04321096).

Though promising, further research is still needed because", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Indeed, case fatality rate (CFR) estimates from China and Italy have shown that being old increases the risk of dying from COVID-19 manifold. 77 In China, CFR for 40-49 years old individuals was 0.4% while for those aged above 80 was 14.8% as of February 11, 2020. 78 In Italy, the CFR values estimated until March 30, 2020 were 0.7% for individuals aged between 40 and 49 years while it was 22.7% for individuals aged 80 and above. 79 In the United States, between February 12 and March 16, 2020, about 80% of the COVID-19 related deaths occurred in individuals who were 65 years or older. 80 Table 1 describes CFR for different age groups in some countries.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF3": {"text": "Moreover, a study done in Veneto, Italy found no evidence for the role of ADT in protecting patients from the poor prognosis of COVID-19, as 25% of prostate cancer patients died from COVID-19 than the 13% average infected Italian males.120 One of the reasons for the huge differences in results could likely be due to different levels of social distancing practices observed by the two research groups in Veneto, Italy. Moreover, Montopoli et al., 115 did not define the stage of pancreatic cancer in patients that were investigated, while Caffo et al., 120 studied a total of 1949 pancreatic cancer patients all of whom were in the advanced stage of their disease. It is likely that differences in stages of pancreatic cancer could have significantly produced divergent observations made by the two scientists. 120 1.3.2 | Therapeutic strategies based on TMPRSS2 protease inhibition Besides ADT, there have been other treatment options suggested for inhibiting or decreasing the TMPRSS2 expression as a therapeutic target. There are various publications that have indicated a plethora of TMPSS2 inhibitors and among these inhibitors, one of the most promising inhibitors that could be used for COVID-19 treatment is Camostat Mesylate (CM). The inhibitor has been shown to protect mice from death after lethal injection with SARS-CoV. In Japan, CM is already being used as a treatment drug, for diseases other than COVID-19.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF4": {"text": "Recently, Nafamostat mesylate (INN) has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host Calu-3 human cell lines with 15 times higher efficiency than the CM.125 A molecular docking study by Sonawane et al.,126 has shown that the three abovementioned TMPRSS2 protein inhibitors strongly interact with the His296, Ser441, and Asp435 TMPRSS2 protein residues present in the ABBASI ET AL. catalytic region that results in the inhibitory action of these blockers.The authors also found that among these inhibitors, CM shows the strongest binding with TMPRSS2. Finally, Bestle et al.,127 used aprotinin and two synthetic TMPRSS2 inhibitors called MI-432 and MI-1900. Treatment with these inhibitors resulted in a maximum of 20-to 35-, 5-, and 25-to 70-fold decrease of SARS-CoV-2 titers in Calu-3 cell lines compared to uninfected Calu-3 cells, respectively. Among the abovementioned TMPRSS2 inhibitors, only CM is currently being investigated as a treatment option for COVID-19 in a clinical trial (National Library of Medicine, 2020 [NLM]", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
