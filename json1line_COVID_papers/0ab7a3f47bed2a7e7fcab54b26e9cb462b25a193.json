Here, we examine putative sources of variability that distinguish individuals with a more negative versus positive valence bias using structural equation modeling. Our model reveals that one's propensity toward negativity (operationalized as temperamental negative affect and internalizing symptomology) predicts valence bias particularly in older adulthood when a more positive bias is generally expected. Further, variability in social connectedness (a propensity to seek out social connections, use those connections to regulate one's own emotions, and be empathic) emerges as a notable and unique predictor of valence bias, likely because these traits help to override an initial, default negativity.

Indeed, extant literature in depression and anxiety 2,12,13 , including subclinical symptomology 14 , has focused on responses to clear valence (e.g., sad or angry expressions), and described exaggerated responses to negativity as an attentional bias (toward negativity and away from positivity; see also 15 , which may suffer from floor or ceiling effects.

For example, although some facial expressions have a relatively clear negative (e.g., angry) or positive valence (e.g., happy), other expressions (e.g., surprise) are ambiguous because they signal both negative (e.g., witnessing an accident) and positive events (e.g., receiving an unexpected gift). When presented without contextual information, these ambiguous expressions are used to identify one's valence bias, or the tendency to interpret ambiguity as having a more negative or positive meaning (e.g., 21-23 ). In this paradigm, the valence bias (which is conceptually similar but distinct from the construct of negativity bias) is not related to attention allocation-both positive and negative information are available within the visual information provided. Rather, it measures one's tendency to perceive negativity when both negative and positive response options are equally valid. As such, this task does not constrain the valence of the participant's response. Further, in contrast to neutral faces that are devoid of emotional meaning (i.e., neither negative or positive response are necessarily valid), surprise has a meaning (high arousal) that predicts both positive and negative outcomes (dualvalence representation) depending on the context.

Thus, our responses to uncertainty can have dramatic and widespread consequences. For instance, a more negative bias in response to uncertainty might preclude individuals from reaping benefits associated with potential rewards (e.g., stock market gains, lottery winnings). On the other hand, a more positive bias exposes individuals to aversive outcomes (e.g., economic downturns, financial loss).

Table 3 reports sample size for each variable and Supplementary  Table S2 reports covariance coverage. Further, full information maximum likelihood estimation (FIML 87 ) is considered an optimal approach to addressing missing data patterns of this magnitude. Thus, by implementing FIML, we capitalized on all available data from this large dataset. Additionally, robust standard errors were estimated using the MLR estimator in Mplus to address any violations of univariate or multivariate normality. We applied a latent moderated structural equations method 57 for testing moderation hypotheses. Multiple indices were used to assess global model fit. The comparative fit index (CFI > 0.90), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI > 0.90), root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA < 0.08), and standardized root-mean residual (SRMR < 0.08) are reported. Once a model was determined to adequately fit the data, parameter estimates were interpreted. Three latent variables were modeled. The metric of the latent variables was set by fixing the variance of the latent variables to 1.00,thus, latent scores were standardized. First, scores from the BDI, DERS, NEON, STAIS, and STAIT were modeled as indicators of a latent variable representing negative affect. Second, scores from the www.nature.com/scientificreports/ EQ, IRQ, and NEOE were modeled as indicators of a latent variable representing social connectedness. Third, valence bias for faces (VB-faces and scenes) (VB-scenes) were modeled as indicators of a latent variable representing valence bias. In this model, the latent scores of negative affect and social connectedness were used to predict valence bias. In addition, we explored interactive effects of age and negative affect, predicting that age might play a more critical role in the relationship between negative affect and valence bias given prior work demonstrating that increasing age is associated with a more positive valence bias 43, 62 . In other words, we expected that the association between negative affect and valence bias would vary as a function of age such that negative affect might have a stronger impact on valence bias in older age when a more positive bias might otherwise be expected. In contrast, we did not have predictions about the effects of social connectedness as a function of age. Thus, we added the interaction between negative affect and age as a predictor of valence bias.

In the present study, we set out to (a) determine the putative sources of variability that might distinguish individuals with a more negative versus positive valence bias, and (b) establish the importance of the valence bias task in exploring individual differences relevant to subclinical symptomology. We conducted an analysis of data collected across 14 experiments that similarly assessed valence bias in each participant, and also collected a variety of individual difference measures thought to have a potential role in explaining valence bias. Our hypothesis is that valence bias is related to (some set of) individual differences in measures of negative affectivity and social connectedness. We predict that the effect of social connectedness will be particularly important in promoting a positive valence bias given that, at least in young adults, the negative bias represents the initial or default response. In other words, although there are likely important individual differences that reinforce a more negative bias, the ability to override the default negativity may more critically rely on variability in social connectedness that helps to downregulate or overcome the tendency toward negativity. In contrast, a low propensity toward experiencing negative emotions (low sensitivity to distressing stimuli) may not be sufficient to demonstrate a positive bias, at least in young adulthood.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "acknowledgement"}, {"text": "This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIMH111640; PI: Neta), and by Nebraska Tobacco Settlement Biomedical Research Enhancement Funds.
