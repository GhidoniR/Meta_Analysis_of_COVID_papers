However, these are well known and long studied animal viruses that only sometimes enter the human population. Coronaviruses are slightly different, as among the myriads of viral species and subspecies found in animals, it is unlikely to predict the place, the time, and the genotype of the coronavirus that will emerge. The classic transmission route of these viruses encompasses the spillover of the bat species to wild or domesticated animals, rapid evolution in this intermediate host, and subsequent transmission to humans. Coronaviruses emerge at different sites of the globe where the interaction between humans and animals is broad, such as the Asian wet markets and the dromedary camel farms in the Arabian peninsula.

In addition to the high variability and ability to elude immune recognition, there are several aspects to be considered. First, the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of the infection was previously reported for some coronaviruses, including sarbecoviruses. ADE is based on the fact that the virus exploits non-neutralizing antibodies to enter the host's cells utilizing the Fc receptor (FcR). The ADE phenomenon was originally observed for antibodies specific to certain dengue virus serotypes developed after a primary infection. During subsequent dengue infections, caused by a different virus serotype, these antibodies were able to recognize the virus but were not capable of neutralizing it. Instead, antibodies bridged the dengue virus and the Fc receptors of the immune cells, such as macrophages and B-cells, mediating viral entry into these cells and transforming the disease from a relatively mild illness to a life-threatening infection. A similar mechanism was later observed for HIV and Ebola infections (Takada et al., 2003 (Takada et al., , 2001 Guzman et al., 2007; Whitehead et al., 2007; Beck et al., 2008; Dejnirattisai et al., 2010; Willey et al., 2011; Katzelnick et al., 2017) . Importantly, ADE has also been reported for some coronaviruses. The bestdocumented ADE cases are associated with feline infectious peritonitis virus. It was shown that immunization of cats with feline coronavirus spike protein leads to increased severity during future infections due to the induction of infection-enhancing antibodies (Corapi et al., 1992; Hohdatsu et al., 1998) . Further, some studies show that antibodies induced by the SARS-CoV spike protein enhance viral entry into FcR-expressing cells (Kam et al., 2007; Jaume et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2014) . It was confirmed that this Abs-dependent SARS-CoV entry was independent of the classical ACE2 receptor-mediated entry (Jaume et al., 2011) . A recent study investigated the molecular mechanism behind antibody-dependent and receptor-dependent viral entry of MARS-CoV and SARS-CoV pseudoviruses in vitro (Wan et al., 2019) . The authors demonstrated that MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) binding to the receptor-binding domain region of the respective spike protein were capable of mediating viral entry into FcR-expressing human cells, confirming the possibility of coronavirus-mediated ADE. Given the critical role of antibodies in host immunity, ADE causes serious concerns in epidemiology, vaccine design, and antibody-based drug therapy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1274, "end": 1294, "text": "(Takada et al., 2003", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1295, "end": 1317, "text": "(Takada et al., , 2001", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1318, "end": 1338, "text": "Guzman et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1339, "end": 1362, "text": "Whitehead et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1363, "end": 1381, "text": "Beck et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1382, "end": 1409, "text": "Dejnirattisai et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1410, "end": 1430, "text": "Willey et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1431, "end": 1455, "text": "Katzelnick et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1793, "end": 1814, "text": "(Corapi et al., 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1815, "end": 1837, "text": "Hohdatsu et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1967, "end": 1985, "text": "(Kam et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1986, "end": 2005, "text": "Jaume et al., 2011;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2006, "end": 2024, "text": "Wang et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 2145, "end": 2165, "text": "(Jaume et al., 2011)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2329, "end": 2347, "text": "(Wan et al., 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The consequences of ADE may be dramatic, as it may cause lymphopenia and induce or increase the frequency of the cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). This may result directly from the active infection of immune cells, which in response produce large amounts of the inflammatory markers or indirectly, when virus-antibody complex binds to FcR and activates proinflammatory signaling, skewing macrophages responses to the accumulation of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages in lungs. The macrophages secrete inflammatory cytokines, such as MCP-1 and IL-8, which lead to worsened lung injury (Fu et al., 2020) . In both animal models and patients who eventually died from SARS, extensive lung damage was associated with high initial viral loads, increased accumulation of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages in the lungs, and elevated levels of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL-10, and MCP1) (Channappanavar et al., 2016) . Moreover, during the SARS-CoV outbreak in Hong Kong (2003) (2004) , 80% of the patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome after 12 days from the diagnosis, coinciding with IgG seroconversion (Peiris et al., 2003) . Another study by Huang et al. (2020) highlighted an increased release of IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-10, IFN\u03b3, MCP-1, and IP-10 in COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, compared with non-severe cases, severe patients in the intensive care unit showed higher plasma concentrations of TNF\u03b1, IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, MIP-1A, MCP-1, and G-CSF, supporting the hypothesis of a possible correlation between CSS and severity of the disease. An extensive study done by Liu et al. (2019) demonstrated that anti-spike IgGs enhanced the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-6, IL-8, and MPC-1) in Chinese rhesus monkeys through the stimulation of alternatively activated monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) upon SARS-CoV rechallenge. The presence of high MDM infiltrations was shown by histochemical staining of the lung tissue from 3 deceased SARS patients. The blockade of Fc-receptors for IgG (Fc\u03b3Rs) reduced proinflammatory cytokine production, suggesting a potential role of Fc\u03b3Rs for the reprogramming of alternatively activated macrophages.

This may include alternative delivery systems/routes based on, e.g., virus-like particles and intranasal delivery for the IgA mediated response, but it is also important to consider combining the humoral response with the cell-mediated response. Ideally, such an approach might allow for the design of a vaccine carrying carefully selected epitopes to induce only the neutralizing antibodies and epitopes targeted for induction of the cellular response. While neutralizing antibodies impair the virus entry, activated CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells can identify and eliminate infected cells. Moreover, CD4+ helper T-cells are required to stimulate the production of antibodies. Antibody response was found to be short-lived in convalescent SARS-CoV patients (Tang et al., 2011) in contrast to T-cell responses, which have been shown to provide long-term protection (Peng et al., 2006; Fan et al., 2009; Tang et al., 2011) , up to 11 years postinfection (Ng et al., 2016) .

Most of the efforts in this area are directed toward the stimulation of neutralizing antibodies, whereas the cellular immune response is less explored. Considering the importance of T-cell activation for vaccine efficacy, the focus of the work here presented is on the latter. Despite the apparent similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, there is still a considerable genetic variation between these two. Thus, it is not trivial to assess if epitopes eliciting an immune response against previous coronaviruses are likely to be effective against SARS-CoV-2, with the exception of identical peptides shared among subgenera. A restricted list of SARS-CoV epitopes identical to those present in SARS-CoV-2 and resulting positive in immunoassays, has been recently reported (Ahmed et al., 2020) . Nonetheless, the 29 T-cell epitopes described therein are mostly limited to S, N, and M antigens and encompass an exiguous number of Class I Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) alleles. In order to extend the search area to other epitopes, computational predictive models might be applied. Methods for the selection of vaccine peptides are typically based on the predicted binding affinity (or probability of presentation on the cell surface) of peptide-HLA (pHLA) complexes or defined by the physicochemical properties of the peptides (Baruah and Bose, 2020; Grifoni et al., 2020; Lee and Koohy, 2020) .

The mild correlation with the results from Smith et al. (2020) might indicate the usage of equivalent components during some steps of the selection process. A relative concordance between the pHLA stability scores from Prachar et al. (2020) and the associated immunogenic scores computed by our method was observed (Figure 9 ). Moreover, we show that the peptide ranks produced by our immunogenicity model have a higher correlation with the experimentally measured pHLA stability than the ranks obtained by methods relying solely on binding affinity or ligand likelihood predictions. This observation is consistent with works reported in the literature (Harndahl et al., 2012) . We also obtained low immunogenicity scores for all five peptides which have been experimentally confirmed by Rammensee to be unable to activate CD8+ lymphocytes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 132, "end": 153, "text": "Grifoni et al.

Our motivation is that cellular immune response is fundamental for an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and it also mitigates the risks of ADE and CSS which are typically associated with modalities relying on the activation of humoral immune response. We showed that the predictive model, on which our methodology is based outperforms, on Coronaviridae data, other methods used to date for the design of epitope-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Our approach differs from other existing methods and shows a higher correlation with the measured pHLA stability in comparison with methods based solely on binding affinity predictions. The limitations of our method have the same roots as those found in other in silico approaches based on predicting various pHLA properties, i.e., the accuracy of these predictive methods. We expect that with the increasing amount of experimentally validated data and with further algorithmic enhancements in the field of artificial intelligence, the accuracy of such models and the effectiveness of vaccine design will continue to improve. Computational methods have proven to be of considerable support in optimizing the vaccine design process on several occasions. Moreover, a notable improvement in the predicting skills of such methods has been recorded in recent years, admittedly due to the increasing advancements in machine learning coupled with a surge in the availability of powerful computational resources. However, it is important to mention that such tools do not represent a substitute for the laboratory experiments necessary to verify and optimize the safety and efficacy of vaccines.
