Providers reported that not having information from physical examination and on-site testing were limitations of VV for meeting survivorship care objectives. Alternatives such as coordinating examination and testing with local primary care providers and remote examination tools could be explored to address these limitations of VV.Generalizability of these findings is limited because this study included a small sample of providers and CCS at a single institution over a study period defined by restrictions on IPV. Furthermore, satisfaction may be overestimated because of biases introduced by providers selecting which CCS were offered VV and limited uptake of the patient survey.In summary, the COVID-19 pandemic provided the opportunity toassess VV as an option for LTFU care for CCS. Participants in our study expressed a high level of satisfaction with VV and the desire to continue this modality post-pandemic. Despite limitations noted above, results support implementation of VV visits for LTFU care of CCS when IPV are restricted, as well as future research on use of VV as an option for LTFU when barriers to IPV exist. Further studies are needed to explore factors that may enhance the quality of virtual care for survivors and providers, including studies investigating hybrid-care with physical examination and laboratory-testing done by primary care providers and virtual care that incorporates remote examination technology.
