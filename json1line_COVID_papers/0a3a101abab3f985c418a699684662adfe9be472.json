In this paper, we are evaluating the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) in limiting the spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 pandemic during a wedding ceremony from Irbid, Northern Jordan. Agent-based modeling was used in a real wedding event that occurred at the beginning of the spread of the pandemic in Jordan. Two infected nationals of Jordan, who arrived in Jordan about a week before the event, initiated the spread of the pandemic within the contact community. Methods: In this work, a strict national NPI that the government implemented is developed by using an abstract model with certain characteristics similar to the Jordanian community. Thus, the Jordanian community is represented in terms of ages, occupations, and population movements. After that, the extent of the impact of the NPI measures on the local community is measured. Results: We observed the deterioration of the state of society while the epidemic is spreading among individuals in the absence of preventive measures. Also, the results show that the herd immunity case was an epidemic, with a high level of spread among the community with 918 cases during a short interval of time. On the other hand, the preventive measures scenario shows a totally controlled spread with only 74 cases applied on the same interval of time. Furthermore, a convergence in the actual results of the real system with the hypothetical system were detected in the case of applying the strict NPI measures. Finally, strict NPI at the community level following social gatherings seem to be effective measures to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "At the end of 2019, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) evolved as a new pandemic with characteristics similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus.

The way the public respond to the implemented NPI measures is critical to the presentation of the epidemiological curve of the epidemic. This data-driven approach is a critical public health message to safeguard people's commitment and to, possibly, aid the efforts of other countries with similar outbreaks. Considering the potential of future infectious disease epidemics emerging at the local levels, the results under discussion are promising in guiding public health policies aiming at controlling further dissemination of such epidemics. The results of the simulation could be easily transmitted into public health decisions for other infectious diseases that have both asymptomatic and symptomatic phases and both being contagious. This will provide swift decisions and effective implementation of NPI measures. On the other hand, the presented results showed clearly the potential devastating effects of relaxing public health interventions, especially in the absence of a vaccine or antiviral therapies. This may help future research to develop a clear insight that may contribute to implementing public health relevant policies, and to contributing to public health forecasting teams. This especially true as modelling and simulation research is relatively new and underutilized in epidemiology and public health research. Therefore, current research findings broaden our understanding of the possible impact due to potentially overwhelming COVID-19 cases, and allowed better estimation of limitations within available medical resources, such as hospital beds. Date-driven planning and mobilizing of resources will be easier when our results are considered and model results are utilized by public health decision makers.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 38, "end": 43, "text": "fig-8", "ref_id": null}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Hence, the current model showed that the strict NPI measures following the social wedding are vital to contain the epidemic and cannot be relieved. This was also mitigated by local widespread testing and contact tracing, which strongly contributed to a rapid resolution of the epidemic.

As such, it provides support to healthcare settings to be properly function and be able to provide effective, and efficient, care to COVID-19 cases needing medical services. we can conclude that strict NPI measures were successful in reducing the number of infections during the time of the epidemic.
