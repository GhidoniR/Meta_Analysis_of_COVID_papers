The use of barcode scanning to verify ingredients has increased over the past 8 years, from 11.9% in 2011. [1] [2] [3] 6, 9 The use of pictures or video of the compounding process was reported at 25.3% of hospital pharmacies ( Table 6 ).

Enhancements to ADCs are important, available, and necessary to ensure a safe decentralized drug distribution system.

The response by pharmacists has been primarily driven by the USP standards, namely USP <797> and USP <800>. As indicated by the national survey results, many changes in pharmacy practice have taken decades (Figures 1 and 2 ), but those prompted by enforceable standards of practice evolve more quickly. This is reflected by changes in practices for compounding sterile preparations driven by USP <797> and changes in practices for handling of hazardous drugs driven by USP <800>. Survey results show significant improvement in these practices during a short (3-year) time period; they also explain the increase in outsourcing the preparation of sterile compounded products, particularly complex preparations, for which compliance with practice standards is more challenging. incorrectly.

For example, at 54.8% of the largest hospitals (those with 600 or more staffed beds) ambulatory pharmacists provide telehealth visits, as compared with 63.4% of hospitals with 400 to 599 beds, 47.5% with 300 to 399 beds, 33.3% with 200 to 299 beds, 29.4% with 100 to 199 beds, 25.0% with 50 to 99 beds, and 15.1% with fewer than 50 beds (uncorrected \u03c7 2 = 25.2882, df = 6, design-based F(4.47, 1136.19) = 4.7554, P = 0.0005).", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF3": {"text": "Size, Location, and Ownership of Respondents' Hospitals", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF4": {"text": "Medication Order Review and Entry", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF6": {"text": "Primary Method of Maintenance Dose Distribution", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF7": {"text": "Predominant Configuration of Automated Dispensing Cabinets", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF8": {"text": "Use of Machine-Readable Coding", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF9": {"text": "Technology Used During Sterile Product Preparation", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF10": {"text": "Robotics Used During Sterile Product Preparation", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF11": {"text": "Methods Used to Assess Staff Competence to Prepare Compounded Sterile Preparations", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF12": {"text": "Environmental Sampling Program and Reporting", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF13": {"text": "USP <800> Compliance and Gaps", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF14": {"text": "Outsourcing of Compounded Sterile Preparations", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF15": {"text": "Strategies to Evaluate External Compounded Sterile Preparation Outsourcers", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF16": {"text": "24.0832, df = 6, design-based F(4.48, 949.40) = 4.0106, P = 0.0021.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF17": {"text": "Use of Smart Infusion Pumps", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF18": {"text": "Abbreviations: EHR, electronic health record; NS, not surveyed. a Uncorrected \u03c7 2 = 13.9717, df = 6, design-based F(4.24, 1080.41) = 2.7369, P = 0.0251. 95% confidence interval did not include previous-year point estimate.
