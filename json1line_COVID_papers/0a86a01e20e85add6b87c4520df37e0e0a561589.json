Although the World Health Organisation (WHO) and some international bodies like the EU are helping to organise vaccination drives, the logistics seem likely to be primarily organised by countries and reactions to them may have national cultural dimensions. In this context, international comparisons of vaccination strategies and public reactions to them may be useful to help identify common concerns, unusual issues and other factors that disproportionately affect individual nations.

Twitter was chosen because it is a public site, in contrast to much of Facebook and Instagram, and allows researchers to gather tweets in real time. It appears to be the largest multinational free source of English-language public comments in the social web and was chosen for this reason. Any analysis of Twitter is biased towards the demographic that uses it, but this an unavoidable trade-off for a fast, lowcost analysis. It seems likely that older, less educated, and less technologically aware citizens tweet less (Blank et al., 2020; Wojcik & Hughes, 2019) . The tweets from each country were analysed with Word Association Thematic Analysis (WATA), which is designed to identify themes in the differences between two sets of texts (Thelwall, 2021) . The method draws attention to these themes that the analyst must then explain, potentially drawing attention to differences that could otherwise be overlooked (Thelwall et al., in press) . WATA is more directly relevant than other exploratory text analysis methods that do not focus on difference, such as topic modelling (Ramage et al., 2009) . It is chosen in preference to corpus linguistics methods that compare subsets of texts (Kennedy, 2014) because of its use of statistical thresholds and the availability in the integrated software Mozdeh that can also collect tweets.

Antivaccination terms were not included because vaccination rather than vaccine hesitancy was the topic investigated. No terms specifying Covid-19 were added to the first four queries since Covid-19 vaccine seemed to be the only type discussed on Twitter on the day that the collection started, so the extra terms seemed unnecessary and would reduce the number of tweets collected.

The TA part of WATA is like traditional reflexive TA (Braun & Clarke, 2013) except that words are analysed rather than texts and each word is given a single theme. Words matching multiple contexts or themes were ignored. This stage was conducted in parallel for the eight countries, using the same themes for all countries so that the results could be compared. Two rounds of coding were used, first to generate the themes and second to check that each word was in an appropriate theme. Whilst TA usually requires additional round for cross-checking classifications and rearranging themes, to speed the process this was only done once.

This category also includes social media influencers that tweet extensively about news-related topics. There is a fuzzy boundary between social media active politicians and influencers, but influencers were classed as politicians when they declared on official political post. \u2022 Health services: The organizations delivering health care differ between countries.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "International difference vaccine themes on Twitter"}, {"text": "\u2022 Vaccine names or manufacturers: The vaccines developed or deployed varied between countries. \u2022 Lockdown: Tweets from the UK and USA sometimes mentioned the need for social distancing and masks or discussed when social distancing restrictions might ease due to vaccination.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "International difference vaccine themes on Twitter"}, {"text": "\u2022 Vaccine rollout arrangements (except for selecting participants): Countries differ in the details of where and how vaccines are administered.

Tweeters in India mentioned their Co-WIN online portal for booking, and from Nigeria the National Identification Number was mentioned as a possible route to access vaccines. Some Irish tweets mentioned the use of the Defence Forces to help the vaccination initiatives. \u2022 Qualifying for a vaccine: The order in which people get vaccinated may be affected by different factors between nations, such as price, health condition, and job. In the US, the groups mentioned for priority include health workers, essential workers, educators, and older folk. UK tweets mentioned clinically vulnerable groups, carers, health staff, and older age groups.

No other country had terms about the need for vaccination before in-person working, and only Australia also had a term related to the need for Covid-19 economic relief. Vaccine hesitancy in the Black community was also mentioned. \u2022 UK: The UK had health service terms at the top of its list, reflecting a single public body in charge of health in the country. The most distinctive theme was the use of positive terms, however. These included fantastic, lovely, brilliant, pleased, well done, amazing, x and xx. The US had the term excited (to get a vaccine) and Ireland had delighted (to get a vaccine). Other UK issues included whether vaccine passports would be necessary for certain activities, when it would be possible to ease the lockdown (aided by vaccination), and whether the UK Test and Trace system was an expensive failure. Vaccine hesitancy in the Black And Minority Ethnic (BAME) community was also mentioned. \u2022 Canada: Most of the top words were geographic names or codes, politicians or media sources. The relatively large number was due to the prominence of state names, news sources and politicians in addition to national politicians and news sources. The two vaccine qualification issues mentioned were the LTC (long-term care) priority and vaccine mistrust amongst indigenous Canadians. \u2022 India: Many terms from India were geographic or language-related, partly due to state-based differences in COVID-19 strategies and politicians. India included the most terms of any country (10) related to vaccination rollout arrangements. This was partly caused by the public dry run of the vaccination programme, in advance of delivery, and partly by publicity for India running the world's largest vaccination drive (Bagcchi, 2021) . India was the only country with a vaccine sharing term: #VaccineMaitri. This hashtag might be translated as vaccine kindness and was used in stories about India's powerful pharmaceutical industry shipping vaccines to other countries. \u2022 Australia: A uniquely Australian topic was the question of whether vaccination would be required for arriving overseas travellers. There were also terms related to the Australian Open tennis tournament. \u2022 South Africa: Possible corruption in Covid-19-related pay-outs was a unique topic for South Africa. Although corruption has also been alleged in the UK, no associated terms were in the top 100 UK words. Another issue discussed was that a batch of AstraZeneca vaccine might not be able to be used (less effective against the South African virus variant) or exchanged with another country because of its short expiry date. Two businesspeople were also frequently mentioned for their vaccination related comments: Both Khandani Msibi and Unathi Kwaza acted as social media influencers, tweeting opinions about the news. \u2022 Ireland: The Irish list included two entrepreneurs, Pat Phelan and Rory McEvoy. Only South Africa also included businesspeople. All were acting as influencers, commenting in the media and on Twitter about the pandemic to reasonably large numbers followers. \u2022 Nigeria: Two themes were in the top terms for Nigeria alone. First, shortages of palliative medicines for people with Covid-19 was commented on in some vaccine tweets, connecting the two (e.g., they hid the palliative medicines so will they hide the vaccines?) The Nigerian terms also included malaria from tweets calling for vaccination for this disease.

It is limited to a single language, social media service and period and the results are subjective. International differences fot other countries (e.g., China, Vietnam, Brazil, Russia) would not have been found, limiting the generalisability of the findings. Moreover, the method cannot easily be extended to compare between countries using different languages. The word frequency method used may overlook important issues that lack distinctive terms, so the absence of themes should not be taken as evidence of their irrelevance to a country. Another limitation is that the results have not been validated for usefulness, for example by consulting experts about whether they would be informative. The main conclusion is that the method was able to quickly identify some meaningful differences between countries. Whilst many of the themes reflecting differences were irrelevant to Covid-19 vaccination programmes (e.g., slang, geographic names, media and politicians' names), and others provided a reminder of structural differences in programmes that an expert might already know (e.g., different vaccine priority strategies, different vaccination infrastructures, the vaccine passport issue, apparently failed test and trace systems, corruption allegations), a few suggested other underlying differences that may be of interest, as follows.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion and conclusions"}, {"text": "The differing relevance of independent medical experts is a potential concern given that coherent public health messages are necessary for vaccination programs.

Similarly, the absence of prominent independent health experts does not indicate national consensus about vaccination, as in the case of the USA with a high level of vaccine hesitancy (Funk & Tyson, 2020) but no independent health expert in the tweet terms examined. The presence of non-scientific influencers from the business community in Ireland and South Africa is a potential cause for concern on this sensitive topic, although mainstream news sources may also be non-expert influential commentators.

In brief, tweeter genders were guessed using lists of commonly gendered first names in each country from gender-api.com (at least 90% used by males or females, ignoring people with other names). This produced enough gendered names for analysis in all countries with male or female gendered terms were found for the USA (1360 statistically significant terms), the UK (1125), Canada (221), Ireland (87), India (52), Australia (27), Nigeria (4) and South Africa (2). Nonbinary genders were detected from they/them pronouns listed in Twitter biographies but there were too few to analyse statistically.Two gendered themes emerged. Except for Nigeria, females focused more on family members (reporting their vaccination). Except for Australia, Nigeria and South Africa, males focused more on politics. The exceptions may have been due to less data in these cases rather than a lack of underlying gender differences.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Appendix: Gender differences"}]}
