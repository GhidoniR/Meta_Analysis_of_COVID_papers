            "text": "Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) is commonly defined as any mining activity of ore deposits that are considered not cost-effective for large-scale industrial extraction [1] . Although cross-country distinctions between artisanal mining and small-scale mining exist, both share a number of common characteristics [2] . For example, both artisanal mining and small-scale mining are activities predominantly pursued by the informal sector, usually involving a few to hundreds of individuals using basic equipment [3] . Consideration of health and safety measures in ASM working processes are low [3] [4] [5] [6] . It is currently estimated that ASM activities are practiced by more than 40 million people in over 120 countries [4, 7, 8] . Most of the activities are concentrated in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) in Africa, Asia, and the Americas [4, 5] . Driven by a number of factors (e.g., demand for minerals, gold price, and poverty), the ASM sector shows a significant diversity in various dimensions: (i) demography (up to 50% of miners are women and 10% are children); (ii) origin of miners (mix of local communities and migrant mine workers); Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 1555 3 of 24 This paper aims to provide a global overview of human health-related studies that have been carried out in ASM contexts, placing particular emphasis on those directly engaged in ASM activities, as well as those living within mining areas and surrounding populations. The research was guided by the following questions: (i) in which countries have ASM activities been conducted and what type of ASM contexts have been studied? (ii) What health effects and ASM-related exposures to health hazards (environmental or biomarkers) were studied? (iii) Which population groups were included in these studies? (iv) What type of environmental and human samples were collected? (v) What type of exposures were measured? (vi) Which signs, symptoms, diseases, injuries, and fatalities were investigated?",

In a third step, titles and abstracts of all records were independently screened by four reviewers, including three authors (H.C., P.A., and R.S.) and one collaborator (A.G.) using EndNote and Microsoft Excel for data management. Discrepancies were discussed in pairs (H. The remaining full texts were screened uniquely by H.C. with support, whenever needed, from M.S.W., applying the following set of inclusion criteria for the final selection of the relevant articles: (i) study was carried out in an ASM environment or an environment affected by ASM; (ii) study investigated human health outcomes and/or human health related indicators (environmental samples or human biomarkers); (iii) the articles is open access or accessible with the rights of the University of Basel (Basel, Switzerland). A post hoc approach for inclusion criteria was applied in order to focus on the comparison of quantitative epidemiological studies solely conducted in the context of ASM.

            "text": "There are several potential underlying reasons why health in the context of ASM lacks pointed research. First, despite the current trend in urban mining, such as gold jewellery manufactures [96] , ASM operations are often performed in distant or difficultto-access settings [2, 8] . Hence, data collections at mining sites are challenging in terms of access, while financial and human resources for research are often constrained [35, 36] . Second, ASM activities are generally informal and take place in contexts with high cultural sensitivities [8, 97, 98] . This poses challenges to accessing people involved in ASM, including vulnerable population groups such as women of reproductive age, children, and ethnic minorities. Third, research efforts that aimed to build on secondary data sources from ASM settings have faced challenges with data availability and quality. For instance, it was found that data availability and quality were limited for estimating disease burden and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to Hg use in ASGM in Zimbabwe and elsewhere [35, 36] . Despite the many potential challenges faced with the implementation of health studies in ASM settings, the high public health relevance-more than 40 million being directly exposed to ASM [4] ; many are vulnerable or marginalised groups [8] ; and many potential health issues [8, 12] -calls for the definition of a comprehensive global research agenda that promotes health research in ASM contexts. This also aligns with ongoing initiatives such as the Global Mercury Partnership and the agenda of the World Bank, which has already recognised this topic as a \"big global data gap\" [15] .",

Among the few studies identified that included vulnerable groups, none focused specifically on the health status of women of reproductive age or children who were directly involved in ASM activities. Hence, health research in ASM contexts largely missed out on the most vulnerable population groups. This is in contrast to existing literature that has long established the vulnerability of women of reproductive age and children in ASM [2, 5, 12, 99] . The limited health data pertaining to these vulnerable groups may be due to fear of ethical issues when conducting research involving vulnerable population groups [100] , the informal nature of the sector [12] , as well as cultural sensitivities and high gender-based inequities [97] , which renders these groups less reachable due to their fear and distrust of participating in research studies [101] . When considering that an estimated 30-50% women and more than one million children are directly involved in ASM activities [15] , better targeting, and inclusion of vulnerable groups in health studies carried out in ASM communities is a pressing need [102] .",

The integration and support from multi-sectoral and multidisciplinary stakeholders, including collaboration with governmental and non-governmental organisations, indigenous populations, local leaders, and potential participants is a common practice and proven useful [49, [105] [106] [107] . The value added of such multi-stakeholder engagement enhances trust between partici-pants and scientists when conducting research involving vulnerable groups [100, 101, 105] .

While the systematic use of multiple biomarkers when assessing the effect of (environmental) pollutants has been suggested previously [108] , the observed strong focus on Hg is striking. This finding may, at least partially, be explained by the adoption of the Minamata Convention on Mercury in 2013, which triggered considerable interest in Hg pollution and exposure in ASGM [102, 109] . Indeed, three-quarters of the articles identified were published after the adoption of the Minamata Convention in 2013. At the same time, the emphasis on Hg use in ASGM may be overshadowing other important health issues that prevail in ASM communities, such as silicosis and tuberculosis, water-and vector-borne disease and sexual health issues, such as STIs, including HIV [23] . This is confirmed by a global study showing that ASM scholars and practitioners are more concerned with Hg exposure in ASM communities than other health hazards [14] . Indeed, Hg exposure and its toxicological consequences pose considerable health and environmental concerns due to the expansion of ASGM activities into urban and sub-urban communities [96, 110] . With only one quarter of the health studies in ASM contexts that addressed other health issues than Hg exposure in ASGM, there might be an important research gap. Future studies should therefore make an effort to comparatively assess the public health relevance of different chemicals, biological, biomechanical, physical, and psychosocial hazards that occur simultaneously in ASM settings [2, 5, 16] , for ultimately developing a research agenda that addresses all major health risks and opportunities in ASM.",

When considering that 68.8% of the burden of disease in LMICs, where ASM is mostly practiced, is caused by communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases [111, 112] , this finding is surprising. Moreover, it is likely that these conditions are more prevalent in ASM settings compared to the countries' average due to the remote environments and potentially weak local health systems [111, 113] . Indeed, studies have shown that ASM settings are characterised by high prevalence of air-, water-, blood-, and vector-borne diseases [5, 114, 115] , as well as STIs and HIV [5] . The observed \"high polarity\" in health-related studies in ASM context may be linked to limited concern on other health hazards beyond Hg among ASM experts worldwide [14] . As a consequence, today, we face a systematic health data gap in the ASM sector at both national and regional levels, and, thus, scarce knowledge about the existing relationship between ASM activities, and the effect of other harmful exposures to the environmental and human health; a situation that may even further deteriorate in the current and future scenario of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.",

Given the unrestricting nature of our piece (i.e., all types of ASM were included), we feel that our study makes a meaningful contribution to the literature, providing new insights into health research practice in ASM contexts. This scoping review, however, comes with several limitations. First, we did not include grey literature and peer-reviewed articles for which no titles and abstracts in English were available. Second, radiological studies, systematic reviews, and qualitative studies were, post hoc, excluded from data extraction and analysis due to time and human resources constraints. Third, due to the lack of standard terms for investigated adverse health conditions, such as symptoms of Hg intoxication among included studies [27, 63, 82, 116] , misclassification or entry duplication may have occurred during data extraction, which may inflect or deflect our findings. Fourth, we did not characterise the included articles in relation to the location where studies were conducted (e.g., rural vs. urban mining), which might have affected the interpretation of our results [45, 49, 96, 110] . Fifth, we acknowledge that for conclusively judging the inclusion of vulnerable populations groups (e.g., women of reproductive age, children, and ethnic minorities) in health research in ASM contexts, a more holistic review is needed that does not only focus on published peer-reviewed literature.",

At the same time, when considering the global magnitude of ASM practice, the number of health-related studies in ASM appears to be low and several specific contexts are not adequately represented in the existing body of literature. This also applies to ASM activities other than ASGM. Indeed, 88.1% of the articles identified are representing gold mining contexts, and, thus, other ASM commodities, such as coltan and cobalt, both showing increasing demand worldwide, are largely neglected. Furthermore, there is a dearth of studies that have focused on specific vulnerable population groups that are directly involved in ASM processes. In addition to a biased representation of ASM contexts and affected population groups, health studies in ASM communities show a heavy focus on Hg-related exposures and associated health effects, whilst communicable diseases and other health conditions not associated with Hg use have received relatively little attention. Future research efforts addressing the \"global health data gap\" in ASM contexts should diversify in terms of commodities and health issues studies, while also paying particular attention to the most vulnerable population groups.
