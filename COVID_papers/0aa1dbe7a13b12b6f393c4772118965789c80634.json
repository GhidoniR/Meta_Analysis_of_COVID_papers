In addition, viral genotype mapping and phylogenetic analysis were performed to identify the variation features of SARS-CoV-2. Results showed that 57.89% of genetic variations involved in ORF1ab, most of which (68.85%) were nonsynonymous. Haplotype maps and phylogenetic tree analysis showed that amino acid variations in ORF1ab (p.5828P>L and p.5865Y>C, also NSP13: P504L and NSP13: Y541C) were the important characteristics of such clade. Furthermore, these variants showed more significant aggregation in the United States (P = 2.92E-66, 95%) than in Australia or Canada, especially in strains from Washington State (P = 1.56E-23, 77.65%). Further analysis demonstrated that the report date of the variants was associated with the date of increased infections and the date of recovery and fatality rate change in the United States.

However, variations in other genes beyond the Spike protein might be important for the evolution of this virus. SARS-CoV-2 was indicated to evolve into at least three phylogenetic groups, characterized by positive selection from ORF1ab, ORF3a, and ORF8. Of note, for the first time, Velazquez-Salinas et al identified the potential relevance of amino acid Y5865C in ORF1ab, showing that this residue is experimenting directional selection. Also, the increased evolutionary rate of ORF10 was identified by Velazquez-Salinas et al (Velazquez-Salinas et al., 2020) . Moreover, the exoribonuclease (ExoN) of NSP14 knockout mutant assays showed the replication 5 / 34 lockdown in the United Kingdom (du Plessis et al., 2021) . At the phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2, strains were identified as lineage A, B, and C according to variants, and the variant carrying the Y5865C mutation was associated with the lineage S or 19 B (Velazquez-Salinas et al., 2020) .",

It is still unclear whether the different mortality rates or transmission rates observed in different regions may be the consequences of the differences in clade virulence (Mercatelli and Giorgi, 2020) . ORF1 accounts for about two-thirds of the whole genome and encodes two polyproteins, i.e., pp1a (approximately 486 kD) and pp1ab (approximately 790 kD) (Hilgenfeld and Peiris, 2013) , which are processed by two viral cysteine proteases, i.e., papain-like protease (PLpro, Nsp3 domain) and main protease (Mpro or 3CLpro, Nsp5), into 15 or 16 NSPs. Most of these Nsps are involved in the transcription or replication of viral genomes (Sawicki et al., 2007) . SARS-CoV-2. Based on the infection, fatality, and recovery rates, as well as dynamic curves for the emergence of genome variations, in different countries, we identified amino acid variations in ORF1ab at the 5828 and 5865 loci (NSP13: P504L and NSP13: Y541C) and gained insight into COVID-19 outcomes in the United States that contained different proportions of strains with these ORF1ab variations.",

We used the amino acid sequence of the variants for the query. In PolyPhen-2, the HumDiv value was used to evaluate rare alleles and dense mapping of regions and to analyze natural selection, whereas the HumVar value was used to help diagnose Mendelian disease. The closer the value (HumDiv or HumVar) is to 1.0, the greater the effect on 2019nCoVR dataset. We first performed variation frequency integration for whole genomes of SARS-CoV-2 strains over time. We found 1 660 sites with genetic variations, including several regions with a significant number of variations, i.e., ORF1ab (961) and S (162). Notably, variation frequency was markedly enriched from 27 February 2020 (Fig. 1A) . Variation heatmap of countries demonstrated the composition of several significant genetic variation sites, including variation in We next conducted variation annotation of all genome variations according to the NCBI reference sequence NC_045512, with GenBank entry MN908947. In general, we found 1 458 genome variations in coding regions of SARS-CoV-2, 69.48% of which were nonsynonymous. In addition, 66.05% (963/1458) of genetic variations were distributed in ORF1ab, of which 68.85% (663/963) were found to be nonsynonymous (Fig. 1C, Supplementary Table S1 ). As the length of ORF1ab occupied more than two-thirds of the whole genome, the mutation rate of each gene region should be determined in consideration of gene length. We calculated the mutation density of each gene via dividing the mutation number of each gene region by the length of each SARS-CoV-2 gene and found that the ORF10 region had a higher mutation rate (Fig. S3 ). We also found that the average variation frequency of coding regions was 5.48 (ranging from 1 to 597) and of noncoding regions was 6.96 (ranging from 1 to 592).",

Our analysis of genetic variation in early SARS-CoV-2 strains found that most variations were in ORF1ab, and most variations in ORF1ab were nonsynonymous. As nonsynonymous variations are usually under stronger negative selection than synonymous variations (Fusaro et al., 2011). It has been reported that functional constraints on viral genomes are weakened after the disruption of ORF1ab in SARS-CoV-2 (Tang et al., 2020).",
