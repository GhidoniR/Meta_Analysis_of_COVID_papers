It has four main structural J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f proteins such as Envelope glycoprotein (E), Spikes glycoprotein (S), Matrix/membrane glycoprotein (M) and nucleocapsid (N). For the selection and entry into the target cell, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 uses its spike proteins. Crown-like shape of the spikes protein forms homotrimer onto the viral surface and helps in binding of viral body onto the ACE2 receptor of the host cell. When coexpressed, the instinctive envelope trimeric S glycoprotein is incorporated onto virus like particle in order to cause infection [12] . According to recent reports, a protein on host surface, cellular protease TMPRSS2 is used for SARS-CoV-2 priming [13] . Therefore, the diagnosis of lethal pathogen SARS-CoV-2 can be done by various methods including RT-PCR and CT-scans [14] . CT scan findings are considered better and authentic than RT-PCR diagnostics due to its good sensitivity power. The sensitivity of CT-scan was observed as 97.2% as compared to RT-PCR (83.3%). So patients with promising CT-scan findings and negatively reported on PCR should be isolated [15] .",

After analyzing all the data, we found that the peptide sequences from 206-215 amino acids can speed up the desired immune response and declared as B-cell epitopes. The results obtained from this method are explained in Figure S3a and Table 2 . Antigenicity of experimentally known amino acid epitopes was examined by the Kolaskar and Tongaonkar method [29] . The maximum tendency of antigenicity was found to be 1.235 and the minimum value was 0.904. The average observed value was 1.053. Threshold value was adjusted at 1.00 and all the values greater than 1.00 were candidates of antigenic factors. Total 7 epitopes were found satisfying the threshold value and selected for further analysis. They were found to have potential to initiate B-cell response. The results of antigenicity analysis are shown in Figure S3b and Table 3 . Good surface accessibility is an important factor for an effective B-cell epitope. Therefore, Emini surface accessibility tool was utilized for this prediction. The default threshold value was found as 1.000 and total 7 epitopes were selected passing the default value of threshold.

Immunoinformatics involving computational methods such as molecular docking has been recognized as a potent tool when it comes to predict the protein-protein interaction. Various studies have reported the involvement of TLR particularly TLR3 in generating immune response against SARS-CoV-2. A research has described the specificity of TLR3 in the action of innate immunity [47] . Docking is done by Clustpro2.0 showing that the model 9 of the vaccine-receptor complex exhibits promising interaction proximal to reference structure. Least energy value of the docked complex shows the stable interaction and less RMSD from the original conformation. The presence of strong electrostatic, van der Waals, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interaction making ligand in stable configuration inside the binding pocket of the receptor [37] . Docking gives us single snapshot of complex physiological movement. Therefore, there is a need to study protein-protein interaction in a more flexible environment [33] . For this purpose, molecular dynamics simulation was performed mimicking the natural behavior of our dynamic system. The results indicated various factors that are explained in Figure 4 . The figure explains the MNA mobility of the complex structure, deformability values, B-factor, eigenvalues, c-variance and elasticity of the complex. Based on maximum eigenvalue, the constructed complex shown to be stable and reveals less chances of deformation during immune response. Immune simulation of the designed construct was discovered by co-variance matrix analysis and its output was in accordance with the immune responses. The humoral response was anticipated to be produced as a result of vaccine introduction in the body [48, 49] .",

In order to validate the designed vaccine, it was tested for immunoreactivity [50] , which was done by expressing it in E. coli [51] .

In silico vaccine with a good immune response and population coverage is the potential candidate for clinical trials. In silico immune simulation showed immune response in accordance with the clearing of antigen. Computational cloning in PET28a (+) plasmid using snapgene showed good protein expression. However, to ensure the efficacy of vaccine construct against COVID-19, experimental validation is essential. In many trials, peptide vaccines had shown good results with a better immune response, so this vaccine construct may be considered.",

From the previous experimentation, GPGPG and AAY linkers were integrated between the predicted epitopes to develop a potential vaccine with optimum antigenicity. In order to link the adjuvant with first predicted B-cell epitope, an EAAAK linker adjusted in the sequence design. The entanglement of this linker has been reported in designing bi-functional peptides which boosts the fused protein. The 6x His tag at the C terminal of sequence, also acknowledged as polyhistidine tag, is motif of at least 6 histidine residues fused to the carboxyl (C-) terminal. Histidine residues bind to immobilized ions, making easy for the sequence to work in a buffer condition[46].The bioinformatic analysis together with immunologic investigation directed that the constructed protein sequence has absence of allergenic as well as toxic properties. Few documented studies reveal the low value of antigenicity of vaccine construct. Although, this constructed vaccine chimera expressed satisfactory antigenic score either bound to adjuvant or not. The molecular weight of designed vaccine protein was found to be 32kDa and it was further analyzed for its solubility according to its stimulated antigenicity. Approving the basic nature of vaccine protein, the theoretical pI of the vaccine is 5.71. The vaccine shows low instability index having the value of 26.63, which means the designed vaccine protein, is stable and could be presumed as a vaccine model when expressed. The chimeric vaccine construct was predicted to be thermostable as per aliphatic index calculations. The secondary and tertiary structures are considered vital in the vaccine design. The secondary structure analysis of the chimeric vaccine protein was found to be consisting 49% helix, 13% beta turns and 37% coil. The refinement of 3D structure of chimeric vaccine construct was performed by GalaxyRefine and desirable properties were obtained. RAMPAGE (Ramachandran Plot) shows the suitable properties that are required for a potential vaccine candidate.
