The SARS-CoV-2 patients were age and sex matched with previously described SAB (6) and NIC (7) cohorts ( Figure 1 ). No other demographic information was available for the patients recruited in theses cohorts. The serum samples for the SAB and NIC cohorts were stored since their initial recruitment in accordance with well-known laboratory storing procedures at -80\u00b0C ensuring adequate back-up capacity for the freezers under the supervision of trained personnel and with ongoing alarm systems designed to monitor the temperature. Serum IL-6 from each patient cohort was quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay (Crux Biolabs \u00ae , Australia) following manufacturers' instructions (8) and read at a wavelength of 450 nm with a FLUOstar Optima plate reader (BMG labtech \u00ae ).",

Characteristics of matched cohorts (COVID, SAB and NIC) were compared using sign-rank test and McNemar test. IL-6 levels between cohorts (SAB vs COVID and NIC vs COVID) were compared using paired t-test. Univariable logistic regression was used for evaluation of demographic, clinical and laboratory variables with supplemental oxygen requirement. Results were expressed as odds ratios (95% CI). Competing risk time to event analysis was performed to measure the association of IL-6 and CRP with oxygen supplementation. The measured treatment outcomes were admission to ICU, oxygen therapy or a composite of both. Discharge was taken as competing risk and IL-6/CRP were separately entered as admission values and as timevarying covariates. Results were reported as sub-hazard ratios ",

IL-6 is secreted by a plethora of immune and stromal cells and exerts effects on a similarly broad array of cellular targets translating into functional pleiotropy including the synthesis of acute phase proteins in the liver, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), a surrogate for IL-6 (10, 11).

We noted a stronger association between simple laboratory parameters (i.e. CRP) and bedside observations (i.e. SpO 2 and respiratory rate) with disease severity, over IL-6. In our cohort, IL-6, CRP, ferritin and LDH were raised at hospital admission while lymphocytes were reduced in line with previous reports (14) (15) (16) . Further, in another clinical prospective study on longitudinal immune profiling with a median of two time points of peripheral blood collection, the authors indicated an association between serum IL-6 at the time of hospital admission and the severity of COVID-19, defined based on the degree of respiratory failure (16) . Similar, in a larger retrospective longitudinal study (N=317), the authors showed the same pattern of increased inflammatory markers within the initial 24 hours after admission as described in our study and previously described study and correlation with disease severity for IL-6 more than 50 pg/ml on multivariable logistic regression (17) . Vultaggio et al. (2020) found that in a cohort of 208 patients, 63 presenting clinical deterioration (defined as oxygen therapy, ICU admission, and death), IL-6 and CRP were predictors of negative outcomes in the first 3 days after hospital admission (18) . In another study, maximal IL-6 (>80 pg/mL) and CRP (>97 mg/L) levels before intubation showed the strongest association with the need for mechanical ventilation in a cohort of COVID-19 hospitalized patients (19) . These findings along with the results from our study support the use of CRP, a routinely available test, as a reliable predictor of clinical outcome in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Whilst, in our cohort, ferritin, D-dimer and LDH were not useful to monitor response to COVID therapies but, as discussed, were a marker of acute disease.",

Our unique perspective of comparing IL-6 values among patients with other diseases, in particular those with an associated CS phenotype, provides insight into the underlying pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2. CS is a somewhat controversial disease state with hyper-cytokinemia including IL-6 as key features (20) . In a recent study from the Netherlands, the authors showed that IL-6 values were lower in patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) when compared to patients with septic shock with ARDS or septic shock without ARDS (21) . This was supported by our research, illustrating lower IL-6 values in the SARS-CoV-2 positive patients compared to patients with SAB. The idea that CS is not a prominent feature of severe COVID-19 as previously thought is growing in popularity and is supported by our study. Further examination of novel biomarkers in COVID-19 is required. In the interim, the use of routine tools such as CRP and bedside vital signs may offer the most reliability for clinical prediction.",
