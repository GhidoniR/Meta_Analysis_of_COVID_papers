However, practical exploitation of KIBs is hampered by the lack of high-performance cathode materials. Here we report a potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate (K 2 Mn[Fe(CN) 6 ]) material, with a negligible content of defects and water, for efficient high-voltage K-ion storage. When tested in combination with a K metal anode, the K 2 Mn[Fe(CN) 6 ]-based electrode enables a cell specific energy of 609.7 Wh kg \u22121 and 80% capacity retention after 7800 cycles. Moreover, a K-ion full-cell consisting of graphite and K 2 Mn[Fe(CN) 6 ] as anode and cathode active materials, respectively, demonstrates a specific energy of 331.5 Wh kg \u22121 , remarkable rate capability, and negligible capacity decay for 300 cycles. The remarkable electrochemical energy storage performances of the K 2 Mn[Fe(CN) 6 ] material are attributed to its stable frameworks that benefit from the defectfree structure.",

For this reason, sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) have been considered as the promising complementary alternatives to LIBs owing to the utilization of earth-abundant and much cheaper sodium and potassium elements 2, 3 . Besides, the electrode materials in NIBs and KIBs are usually free from toxic and expensive cobalt, which is one of the essential elements in state-of-the-art LIBs. Over the past decades, great progress has been made for non-aqueous NIBs which are being commercialized by few startup companies 4 .",

(1) The redox potential of K + /K is more negative than that of Na + /Na (and even Li + /Li) in some nonaqueous electrolytes, leading to potentially high voltages of KIBs that are similar to LIBs and relatively higher energy density than that of NIBs 5,6 ; (2) the graphite anode can reversibly take and release K-ions with a theoretical capacity of 279 mAh g \u22121 , making it possible to transfer the well-established graphite anode industry of LIBs to KIBs, whereas the anode for the commercialized NIBs utilizes the more expensive hard carbon 4 ; (3) K-ion electrolytes reveal the highest ionic conductivity because of the weakest Lewis acidity and smallest Stokes radius of K-ions than those of Na-ions and Li-ions 7 . Although the aforementioned merits make KIBs very attractive, the success of KIBs, mainly relying on the cost effectiveness of KIBs over contemporary LIBs technology, can only be realized if ultra-long lifetime is achieved for KIBs, as recently emphasized by Yan and Obrovac through a detailed cost analysis 8 . The cycle life of KIBs mainly hinges on the charge-discharge reversibility of their electrode materials. On the anode side, reversible potassiation-depotassiation of commercial graphite anode with an impressive cycle life over 2000 cycles has been reported 9 . However, the reported cathode materials, particularly those with extractable K-ion source which can be paired with practical K-free anodes, usually exhibited unsatisfactory long-term cycling performance 5 . The lack of low-cost and highperformance K-containing cathode materials has hindered the development of practical KIBs.",

The general composition of PBAs can be expressed as A x M[M\u2032(CN) 6 ] 1\u2212y \u25a1 y \u2022nH 2 O (0 \u2264 x \u2264 2, y < 1), where A represents alkaline metal ions, M/M\u2032 represent the transition metals (Fe, Mn, Co, Ni, etc.), and x, y, and n represent the contents of alkaline metal ions, [M\u2032(CN) 6 ] vacancies, and crystal water (including ligand water which occupies the [M\u2032(CN) 6 ] vacancy sites and is chemically bonded with the unsaturated M ions and zeolite water which is located in the interstitial sites), respectively. The 3D open and flexible framework of PBAs enable the reversible storage of large K-ions. More intriguingly, PBAs seem to be the only cathode candidate which shows a preference for K compared with Li and Na. The better fit of K-ions in the cavities of PBAs stabilizes the structure, leading to higher redox voltage and more stable cycling performance in KIBs over LIBs and NIBs 5, 16 .",

More encouragingly, over 80% of its capacity can be retained after 7800 cycles, which is the best long-term cycle life among all the reported cathode materials for KIBs. Experimental investigations combined with theoretical calculations reveal that the eliminated defects and negligible water in the sample play critical roles in stabilizing its cycling performance. Finally, the prototype potassium-ion full-cell consisting of the obtained cathode and graphite anode could demonstrate a specific energy as high as 331.5 Wh kg \u22121 (based on the total mass of cathode and anode materials) and negligible capacity loss after 300 cycles, as well as remarkable rate performance (58% capacity retention at 6.67 C vs. 0.1 C), promising the practical application of KIBs as a lowcost and stable energy storage system.",

Hence, the [Mn(EDTA)] 2\u2212 will act as the reservoir to slowly release Mn 2+ during the precipitation reaction. Consequently, the nucleation and growth of K 2 Mn[Fe(CN) 6 ] can be greatly suppressed, which will result in an sample (denoted as KMF-EDTA) with significantly reduced defects and water. According to the published work 20 , the reactant concentration of 0.04 M and arbitrarily chosen reaction time of 4 h are used in this work which result in a product yield of 74% (see Materials Synthesis section in the Supplementary Information for detailed synthesis procedure). It is later discovered that the reaction time could be further reduced for scale up synthesis because of the fast reaction between the reactants (vide infra).",

The corresponding crystal structure of KMF-EDTA is illustrated in Fig. 2b , revealing a distorted open framework with C-coordinated Fe cations and N-coordinated Mn cations 21 . The ICP-MS analysis (Supplementary Table 2 ) gives a K:Mn:Fe molar ratio of 1.94:1:0.994, suggesting a high K-ion content and exceedingly low [Fe(CN) 6 ] vacancies (0.6 at.% vs. Mn). TGA is applied to estimate the water content in the sample. As shown in Fig. 2c , the KMF-EDTA sample exhibits a negligible weight loss under 100\u02daC and a considerably low weight loss (~0.44 wt.%) from 100 to 200\u02daC, which can be ascribed to the evaporation of weakly coordinated ligand water 8 , implying that this sample does not require extensive vacuum dehydration before cell assembling. Fouriertransform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the KMF-EDTA sample ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ) shows a single peak around 2067 cm \u22121 , which is ascribed to the vibration of Mn 2+ -N \u2261 C-Fe 2+ bonds 22 . The characteristic signals of water molecules are absent in the FT-IR spectra, further bearing out the extremely low residual water content in the KMF-EDTA. As shown by the TGA-MS result in Fig. 2d , even after stored in room atmosphere for 14 days, KMF-EDTA only demonstrates a slightly increased water uptake (~1.3 wt.%) compared with the as-synthesized sample. Furthermore, negligible release of HCN is detected for KMF-EDTA during heating, indicating that this material preserves its intact structure. The thermal stability of the KMF-EDTA is further characterized by recording its XRD patterns as a function of temperature. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 6 , upon heating in N 2 atmosphere to 300\u02daC, the XRD diffraction signals of KMF-EDTA do not display detectable variations, suggesting its robust crystal structure.",

The X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of Fe and Mn K-edges for the KMF-EDTA ( 6 in the aqueous solution at 327 nm wavelength is monitored during the precipitation. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 10c , the in-situ UV-vis spectrum shows that once adding EDTA-free Mn 2+ solution into the K 4 Fe(CN) 6 solution, the absorption intensity of K 4 Fe(CN) 6 exhibits an abrupt decrease and quickly disappears in 0.5 s. In comparison, it shows a comparatively slow fade rate upon adding the EDTA-containing Mn 2+ solution and finally vanishes after 2.5 s. Consequently, such a 5-fold extension of the precipitation time can greatly suppress the [Fe(CN) 6 ] vacancies from 8% in KMF-C to only 0.6% in KMF-EDTA, enabling more K-ions (1.94 in KMF-EDTA vs. 1.72 in KMF-C) in the lattice 25 , which is beneficial for assembling the KIB full-cells with a potassium-free anode (e.g., graphite). The significantly decreased [Fe(CN) 6 ] vacancies and remarkably increased K-ions content also greatly reduce the occupancy sites for ligand water and zeolite water, greatly reducing the water content (0.44 wt.% in KMF-EDTA vs. 7.51 wt.% in KMF-C) 26 , which can minimize the water-related side reactions and enhance the electrochemical performance (vide infra) 10 .",

The electrochemical performances of the samples are examined in potassium metal cells within 2.7-4.4 V (vs. K + /K) with our previously reported non-flammable phosphate-based electrolyte (2.5 M potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide (KFSI) salt dissolved in triethyl phosphate (TEP) solvent), which exhibits an excellent anodic stability (Supplementary Fig. 11 and the corresponding text) and is also well-compatible with the graphite anode 27, 28 . For the following laboratory evaluation of the electrochemical performance of the samples in the coin-type cells, a typical active material loading of 1 mg cm \u22122 is used. Figure 3a shows the galvanostatic charge-discharge potential profiles of KMF-EDTA at 15 mA g \u22121 (0.1 C, 1 C = 150 mA g \u22121 ). During the first charge (depotassiation) process, two distinct voltage plateaus centered at 4.06 and 4.10 V (vs. K + /K) are observed. The subsequent 1 st discharge (potassiation) process displays two corresponding reduction potential plateaus centered at 3.98 and 4.06 V (vs. K + / K). These two pairs of well-defined redox plateaus at 4.06/3.98 and 4.10/4.06 V (vs. K + /K), which are attributed to low-spin Fe 2+/3+ and high-spin Mn 2+/3+ redox couples, respectively 11,12 , maintain almost unchanged over 100 cycles. Remarkably, the potential hysteresis for the two redox couples is only 80 and 40 mV, which are the smallest among all reported PBAs electrode materials 29 . As shown in Fig. 3a , the first charge and discharge capacities of KMF-EDTA are 188.8 and 153.5 mAh g \u22121 with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 81.34%. The first charge capacity of KMF-EDTA exceeds its theoretical value (~156 mAh g \u22121 , corresponding to full depotassiation from K 2 Mn[Fe(CN) 6 ]). Considering the negligible water content in the sample, the excess capacity should be ascribed to the oxidative decomposition of the electrolyte at high voltages, as evidenced by the small voltage tail at the end of the 1 st charge process. After the 1 st cycle, the charge capacity gradually decreases from 164.7 mAh g \u22121 at the 2 nd cycle to 155.6 mAh g \u22121 at the 8 th cycle and the Coulombic efficiency approaches 98%, indicating that the electrolyte decomposition only occurs during the initial few cycles. Figure 3b reveals the cycling performance of the KMF-EDTA cathode at 15 mA g \u22121 . Upon cycling, the material is capable to deliver a reversible capacity of~154.7 mAh g \u22121 (at the 2 nd cycle). It also demonstrates an outstanding cycling stability with a remarkably high capacity retention of 95.7% after 137 cycles (testing period~113 days, 2712 h). Such a low capacity decay rate at this harsh low current rate (~0.1 C) testing condition is impressive, which has never been achieved in the literature for the PBAs-based cathode materials in non-aqueous KIBs. As shown in Fig. 3b , the Coulombic efficiency increases from 94% at the 2 nd cycle to 99.1% at the 16 th cycle, and maintains an average value of 99.2% during the following cycles, verifying a highly reversible potassiation-depotassiation process. The high Coulombic efficiency along with the ultra-low voltage hysteresis enables an extremely high round-trip efficiency (~96%, Fig. 3b ), comparable to that of state-of-the-art LIBs 30, 31 . For the practical applications, the Coulombic efficiency of the sample should be further enhanced to the ideal value (~100%) by optimizing the compositions of the electrolyte or other approaches.",

In addition, the discharge capacity above 3.8 V (vs. K + /K) comprises 91% of its total discharge capacity, which is beneficial for the practical implementation of this material in high voltage KIBs.",

            "text": "First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculation is then used to further elucidate the K-ion storage mechanism in KMF-C and KMF-EDTA. First, the formation energy of KMF-C with defects and water is estimated to be 1.77 eV/formula higher than that of KMF-EDTA (Fig. 4a) , suggesting the thermodynamically more unstable structure of KMF-C than that of KMF-EDTA. Second, as shown in Fig. 4b , the calculated voltage for K-ion insertion is higher for KMF-EDTA than that for KMF-C, which is in qualitative agreement with the experimentally obtained equilibrium potentials by the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique ( Supplementary Fig. 21) . Third, the calculation also indicates a higher K-ion diffusion energy barrier in KMF-C than that in KMF-EDTA (0.65 eV vs. 0.53 eV) (Fig. 4c) , which originates from the stronger interaction between K-ion and the defective host structure in KMF-C as evidenced by the differential charge density diagram (Fig. 4d , e, Supplementary Table 6 and the corresponding text). Thus, both the thermodynamic and kinetic origins are expected to account for the observed lower discharge potential for KMF-C. Previous calculation indicates that the binding strength of H 2 O with the lattice will be significantly weakened as Na-ion is extracted from Na x MnFe(CN) 6 \u2022nH 2 O, which enable water to escape during the Na-ion extraction process 36 . Such electrochemical dehydration was shown to raise the redox potentials in Na x MnFe (CN) 6 \u2022nH 2 O 37 . Similar phenomenon is also expected to take place in KMF-C, as evidenced by the variation of its differential capacity (dQ dV \u22121 ) curve upon cycling (Supplementary Fig. 13d ) and further supported by the upshift of the charge-discharge potential of KMF-C after the sample is dehydrated (Supplementary Fig. 22 ). The escaped water from KMF-C will induce side reactions, causing its capacity degradation and low Coulombic efficiency. Moreover, DFT calculation also indicates the binding strength towards Mn-ion is stronger for the currently used TEP solvent than that for water (binding energy: 0.52 eV for Mn-TEP vs. 0.09 eV for Mn-H 2 O). Hence, once ligand water molecules escape from the lattice, the remaining exposed Mn-ion at the defect sites is susceptible to be coordinated by the TEP solvent and dissolve into the electrolyte. The ICP-MS results (Supplementary Table 7 ) bear out that the dissolved Mn content is much higher in the KMF-C cell than that in the KMF-EDTA cell (4 mg L \u22121 for KMF-EDTA vs. 11 mg L \u22121 for KMF-C) after 100 cycles. Self-discharge tests of two samples ( Supplementary Fig. 23) show that 92% of its discharge capacity can be achieved for KMF-EDTA after rest for 120 h at the fully charged state while this value is 86% for KMF-C. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 23 , the capacity loss of KMF-C is mainly caused by the reduced capacity from the high potential plateau corresponding to the Mn 2+ /Mn 3+ redox couple, due to the dissolution of Mn-ion into the electrolyte.",

            "text": "Based on the above experimental and theoretical investigations, it can be concluded that the underlying reasons for the inferior electrochemical performance of KMF-C compared with KMF-EDTA are as follows: (1) the Fe(CN) 6 vacancies and water in KMF-C cause higher K-ion transport barrier, resulting in the increased voltage polarization; 25, 38 (2) the escape and subsequent Electrochemical performance of K-ion full-cells. To evaluate the potential application of the KMF-EDTA cathode in practical KIBs, a prototype K-ion full-cell (denoted as KMF-EDTA | | Graphite) with pristine KMF-EDTA cathode and pristine graphite anode is configured (Fig. 5a) with a negative:positive capacity ratio of 1:1.05 (corresponding to a mass ratio of graphite:KMF-EDTA = 0.6:1). The KMF-EDTA | | Graphite full-cell exhibits a charge capacity of 179.3 mAh g \u22121 and discharge capacity of 130.8 mAh g \u22121 with an average discharge voltage of 3.27 V during its 1 st charge-discharge cycle ( Supplementary Fig. 25) . However, the discharge capacity drops to 103.8 mAh g \u22121 after 5 cycles. Detailed investigation indicates that although the graphite anode could deliver a reversible capacity of~261.7 mAh g \u22121 with good cycling stability and rate capability, its Coulombic efficiency during the initial several cycles of SEI formation is insufficient (Supplementary Fig. 26 ), leading to the capacity decay in Supplementary Fig. 25 . Therefore, the graphite anode is pre-cycled for 12 times to eliminate the effect of SEI and then assembled with pristine KMF-EDTA cathode into the full-cell (denoted as KMF-EDTA | | Cyc-graphite). As shown in Fig. 5b , the obtained KMF-EDTA | | Cyc-graphite full-cell can stably operate between 1.5 and 4.2 V at a low specific current of 15 mA g \u22121 (0.1 C, based on the mass of the KMF-EDTA in the full-cell). After the initial few activation cycles, it is capable to deliver a high capacity of 145 mAh g \u22121 at 15 mA g \u22121 with an average discharge voltage of 3.58 V (Supplementary Fig. 27 ). The average discharge voltage of the KMF-EDTA | | Cyc-graphite fullcell (3.58 V) is even higher than that of the commercial LiFePO 4 | | Graphite cell (3.2 V) 40 . As shown in Fig. 5c , in spite of testing at a low specific current of 15 mA g \u22121 (~0.1 C), the KMF-EDTA | | Cyc-graphite full-cell presents a decent cycling stability with a high capacity retention of 91% after 110 cycles (running time is over 91 days, 2184 h) and high Coulombic efficiency (~99.3%). During cycling, the Coulombic efficiency and round-trip efficiency is stabilized at the values of 99.1% and 92.8%, respectively, indicating the highly reversible redox reactions at both the graphite anode and KMF-EDTA cathode. It is worth noting that the round-trip efficiency of this cell is much higher than that (75-85%) of the commercially available high-temperature Na-S h Average discharge voltage and specific energy versus capacity of some reported K-ion full-cells. Note: both the capacity and specific energy in h are calculated based on the total mass of the cathode and anode materials in the corresponding full-cells, and the data used for plotting h are listed in Supplementary Table 8. battery, which is utilized in stationary energy storage 1 . Owing to its high reversible capacity and high average discharge voltage, the prototype KMF-EDTA | | Cyc-graphite full-cell can deliver a specific energy as high as 331.5 Wh kg \u22121 (based on the total mass of the cathode and anode materials), which outperforms all reported K-based full-cells (Fig. 5h, Supplementary Table 8 ). This value is higher than the specific energy of lead-acid, vanadium redox and nickel metal-hydride batteries and even comparable with the LiFePO 4 | |Graphite cell (Supplementary Table 9 ) [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] .",

            "text": "Moreover, the KMF-EDTA | | Cyc-graphite full-cell also demonstrates good rate capability. As shown in Supplementary  Fig. 28 , reversible capacities of 131.5, 115.9, 102.2, 92.9, 85.7, 74.3, and 66.5 mAh g \u22121 can be obtained at specific currents of 0.03, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 A g \u22121 . It has been reported that the graphite anode possesses excellent high-rate depotasstion capability but poor potassiation capability 6, 45 . The poor potassiation capability of the graphite anode limits the charge performance of the full-cell. Therefore, to further examine the discharge rate capability of the full-cell and avoid the potassium dendrite growth during the charge process, the full-cell was tested with a constant charge specific current of 30 mA g \u22121 (~0.2 C) but various discharge rates. As shown in Fig. 5d , e, under such a test condition, the discharge capacities change only from 131.1 to 84.1 mAh g \u22121 when the discharge rate increases from 0.03 to 1.0 (~6.67 C) A g \u22121 , bearing out the remarkable high rate discharge capability of the full-cell. Moreover, the full-cell also presents superb cycling stability with 98.5% capacity retention after 300 cycles (running time over 112 days, 2880 h) at 30 mA g \u22121 (~0.2 C, Fig. 5f ). Figure 5g presents the corresponding voltage profiles, suggesting the higly reversible charge-discharge process in the full-cell. At a higher specific current (50 mA g \u22121 ), the fullcell can only demonstrate a capacity retention of 85.6% over 235 cycles (Supplementary Fig. 29a ). Compared to the 98.5% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 30 mA g \u22121 , this relatively lower capacity retention at the higher specific current of 50 mA g \u22121 is found to be caused by the increased polarization of the graphite anode ( Supplementary Fig. 29b-g) , which originated from the sluggish potassiation process into graphite 6, 45 , emphasizing the necessity of further improvement of graphite anode for practical KIBs. Moreover, the self-discharge behavior of the full-cell is also evaluated. After charged to 4.2 V, the full-cell is left to rest for 120 h. During the rest period, the full-cell's voltage experiences a sudden drop to 3.9 V initially and then maintains around 3.85 V after 120 h ( Supplementary Fig. 30) . The subsequent discharge test shows that the full-cell can maintain 94% of its initial capacity, which can be further enhanced by future optimization of the full-cell configuration.",

Consequently, the potassium-ion full-cell also possesses one of the crucial safety advantages, i.e., the capability to store and transport at 0 V, indicating a zero energy storage of the cell 4 . To verify its zero voltage storage ability, after being discharged to 1.5 V, the prototype potassium-ion full-cell is held at 0 V for 12 h by a physical short-circuit ( Supplementary Fig. 31 ).

Previous work has demonstrated the great potentials of this material towards K-ion storage. For instance, Goodenough et al. reported K 1.89 Mn[Fe(CN) 6 ] 0.92 \u20220.75H 2 O as the cathode material for KIBs, which could deliver a high capacity of 142 mAh g \u22121 with two close voltage plateaus centered at 3.6 V (vs. K + /K), corresponding to a specific energy of 511 Wh kg \u22121 11 .
