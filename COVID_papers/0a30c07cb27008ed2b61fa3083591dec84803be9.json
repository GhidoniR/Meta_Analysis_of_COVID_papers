In the South region's Rio Grande do Sul state, severe COVID-19 case numbers rose 3.8 fold in February 2021. During that month, at a COVID-19 referral hospital in this state, whole-genome sequencing of a subset of cases' specimens (n = 27) revealed P.1 lineage SARS-CoV-2 in most (n = 24). Findings raise concerns regarding a possible association between lineage P.1 and rapid case and hospitalisation increases.",

This resulted in the collapse of the state healthcare system [1] . Community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) P.1 lineage was documented in a highly visited RS municipality 1 week before week 6 [2] . We thus investigated whether the P.1 variant of concern (VOC) could be detected in patient specimens from February 2021 in a large tertiary care hospital (830 beds) in RS, which serves also as a COVID-19 referral centre in the state capital, Porto Alegre. We also tested specimens obtained in January 2021 to compare with our February 2021 findings, as well as some from the previous year.",

RS was one of the least affected Brazilian states during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave (early July-September 2020), although the number of cases increased markedly from early November to late December 2020 [1] . A previous study conducted in the municipality of Esteio, RS, from May to October 2020 revealed that the most common lineages were B.1.1.33 and P.2 (initially called B.1.1.248) [5] . Genomic surveillance by the central state laboratory confirmed the predominance of these lineages across RS, following a distribution similar to that observed in other Brazilian states, but revealed that lineage P.2, first detected in October 2020, had been gradually replacing these as the predominant variant as of 31 January 2021 [6] . Lineage P.1 was first detected in RS state in a single clinical specimen obtained on 01 February 2021 from a resident of Gramado, a popular tourist destination in RS, who however, had no history of travel or contact with returning travellers from northern Brazil [2] . Whole genome sequencing in the current study detected a specimen with SARS-CoV-2 P.1 lineage from January 2021. It is therefore possible that P.1 variant was circulating in RS before February 2021, though, to date, there are no other published studies to our knowledge confirming this.",

In February 2021, however, an overwhelming increase in hospitalisations was observed from epidemiological week 6, temporally coinciding with the finding that lineage P.1 became predominant, accounting for the vast majority of specimens selected for genotyping in this period, albeit the number of specimens taken was small. P.1 and P.2 lineages are descendants from B.1.1.28 but phylogenetic analysis has revealed that both emerged from independent evolutionary events [8] . P.1 has been termed VOC due to important mutations in the spike protein (K417T, E484K, and N501Y) some of which are found in B.1.351 (South Africa) and B.1.1.7 (United Kingdom) lineages. These mutations have been associated with higher transmissibility as well as a potential to promote reinfection [9] . Lineages harbouring the E484K mutation, such as P.2, are considered variant of interest because of their potential ability to escape from the immune system and their spread should also be monitored [8] [9] [10] .",

Previous findings suggesting that P.1 may be more transmissible than other lineages corroborate our hypothesis [7, 9, 11] . Regarding measures to control SARS-CoV-2 spread, in May 2020, the RS government implemented a system that divided the state into healthcare regions and, on a weekly basis, provided one of four possible classifications for each of such regions, thereby symbolising the risk of transmission. Each classification implied a lower or greater degree of restrictions in social and commercial activities. These included for example incremental reduction of capacity (e.g. hotels) of businesses or their types of provided services (e.g. serving on premises vs take away/delivery for restaurants) or opening hours -with closure of non-essential activities for the highest-risk-related classification. However, none of these measures limited urban or inter-cities mobility [12, 13] . Furthermore, the system relied heavily on hospital capacity (i.e. number of available beds mostly in intensive care units) rather than on community transmission data. In addition, the rules for the restrictions were loosened over time, ultimately resulting in an absence of strict control measures for COVID-19 community transmission during the whole pandemic period. From May 2020 until the present date there was no major change in levels of physical distancing [12] . All these elements might have contributed to the dissemination of a more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 VOC.",

Nonetheless, it should be noted that the criteria for specimen selection of isolates from January (one P.1) and February 2021 (24 P.1) were the same. Second, although consistent with previous findings [9, 11] , the lower Ct values observed in February must be interpreted with caution, because Ct values were not adjusted for time from onset of symptoms.",

Despite the relatively low number of specimens analysed, the finding that the previously undetected P.1 lineage now accounts for almost nine in 10 specimens from a COVID-19 referral hospital in a state where exponential growth in hospitalisations has been observed warrants close attention and highlights the need for VOC surveillance and measures to control the spread. Further studies are necessary to investigate the potential association of P.1 dissemination with rapid increase in hospitalisations. Ct: cycle threshold.",
