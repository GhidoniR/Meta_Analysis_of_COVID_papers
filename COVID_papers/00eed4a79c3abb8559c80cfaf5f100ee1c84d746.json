It becomes the most unprecedent challenge to analytic epidemiology in general and signal processing theories in specific. Given its high contingency nature and adverse effects across the world, it is important to develop efficient processing/learning models to overcome this pandemic and be prepared for potential future ones. In this regard, medical imaging plays an important role for the management of COVID-19. Human-centered interpretation of medical images is, however, tedious and can be subjective. This has resulted in a surge of interest to develop Radiomics models for analysis and interpretation of medical images. Signal Processing (SP) and Deep Learning (DL) models can assist in development of robust Radiomics solutions for diagnosis/prognosis, severity assessment, treatment response, and monitoring of COVID-19 patients. In this article, we aim to present an overview of the current state, challenges, and opportunities of developing SP/DL-empowered models for diagnosis (screening/monitoring) and prognosis (outcome prediction and severity assessment) of COVID-19 infection. More specifically, the article starts by elaborating the latest development on the theoretical framework of analytic epidemiology and hypersignal processing for COVID-19. Afterwards, imaging modalities and Radiological characteristics of COVID-19 are discussed. SL/DL-based Radiomic models specific to the analysis of COVID-19 infection are then described covering the following four domains: Segmentation of COVID-19 lesions; Predictive models for outcome prediction; Severity assessment, and; Diagnosis/classification models. Finally, open problems and opportunities are presented in detail.",

Corresponding Author is Arash Mohammadi, email: arash.mohammadi@concordia.ca the 11 th of March 2020, was characterized as a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO). Given its high contingency nature, relatively unknown behaviour, systemic complications, and adverse effects ranging from human fatalities to economic recessions across the world, it is of importance to develop efficient processing/learning models to help overcome this pandemic and be prepared for potential future ones. The Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is the standard testing approach for early diagnosis of suspected cases of COVID-19. Unavailability of enough RT-PCR testing kits particularly in areas severely affected by the pandemic and its relatively high and variable falsenegative rate (i.e., highest during the first five days (up to 67%), and lowest on day 8 (21%) [2] ), resulted in focusing on medical image Radiomics [3] as a complementary source for diagnosis/prognosis.",

According to the guideline provided by WHO, use of chest imaging as a complementary source of data is recommended in different scenarios and stages of COVID-19 to assist radiologists and physicians to detect and evaluate the disease more accurately. CT and CXR can decrease the false negative rate both at the admission and discharge times. It is worth mentioning that chest CT has a key role for diagnosis of COVID-19 in the very early stages of the infection and also to set up a prognosis. Comparisons between CT and RT-PCR at early stages of COVID-19 infection show that CT abnormalities may appear before PCR positivity. In other words, CT has greater sensitivity during the early stages of the infection. In addition, false negatives in RT-PCR results occur both at the admission and discharge. Finally, CT plays its role over the course of the disease for evaluating changes in severity and for treatment adjustments. The key power of chest imaging is in its prognostic value to identify severity of the arXiv:2012.14106v1 [eess.IV] 28 Dec 2020 disease, likelihood of needing hospitalization and/or admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU). However, interpretation of chest images for confirming the suspected cases of COVID-19, and severity assessment of the disease based on imaging findings are time-consuming and may be challenging.",

In particular, Reference [3] is focused on hand-crafted and deep learningbased techniques for extracting features from cancer-related images. Cancer diagnosis is essentially a completely different task than that of COVID-19 analysis, which requires its own specific techniques and solutions. For instance, while nodules have solid shapes and defined locations, COVID-19 infection areas could be multifocal, ill defined and diverse in pattern or (morphology). Therefore, the traditional Radiomics filters are not applicable to the latter. Furthermore, images from patients with pulmonary malignancies contain far less motion artifacts compared to COVID-19 ones, where patients suffer from dyspnea, calling for more advanced artifact reduction techniques. Deep learning models developed for Cancer Radiomics are also not transferable to COVID-19 without modifications. This is mainly due to the fact that in a patient with COVID-19 a large number of slices may be affected, for which 3D analysis and more powerful resources are required. With regards to differences with recent survay/tutorial articles on COVID-19 research, Reference [4] is limited to deep learning techniques. In this article, however, we also focus on SP modeling, applications, required medical background, and challenges/open-problems. Reference [5] is more focused on the medical background and imaging modalities and AI models are not discussed in a separate section compared to this article, where different models and applications are separated and discussed. Reference [6] reviews a subset of deep learning models, without referring to SP methods, and challenges. The reminder of the manuscript is organized as follows: Section II is devoted to analytic epidemiology and hypersignal processing for COVID-19. Applications and imaging modalities for diagnosis/prognosis of COVID-19 images are then presented in Section III. SL/DL-based Radiomic models specific to the analysis of COVID-19 infection are then described in Section IV covering the following four application domains: Segmentation of COVID-19 lesions; Predictive models for outcome prediction; Severity assessment, and; Diagno-and the set of lab tests be L = L 1 (N ucleicAcid), L 2 (SoreSample), L 3 (LungImage) .",

For COVID-19, a variation of PCR test, the RT-PCR, has been used as a gold standard [21] .

Among the chest imaging modalities, the CXR is less sensitive, and less specific compared to CT. The advantages of CXR over CT include its fast availability, ease of execution, and minimization of in-hospital transmissions. In addition, the CXR findings correlate well with CT findings [22] . In some situations where a fast assessment is necessary, the Point-of-Care lung Ultrasound (POCUS) offers a radiation-free imaging modality with higher accuracy in patients without any previous cardiopulmonary disease [24] . In what follows, application of the above-mentioned imaging modalities for COVID-19 diagnosis/prognosis will be discussed in detail.",

A study [25] on 51 patients with positive nucleic acid testing reported that only 3.9% of patients were misdiagnosed based on their chest CT images. Fig. 3 shows common CT patterns in COVID-19 patients, where the most prevalent are \"Ground Glass Opacities (GGOs)\" and \"Consolidations\". GGO is a hazy transparent opacity that does not conceal lung vessels and bronchial areas [26] . In a consolidation pattern, the air in the alveoli and peripheral bronchioles is replaced by fluid such as pus, water, blood, or an inflammatory material, obscuring the underlying distal airways and vascular margins [26] . In a research study on 645 confirmed COVID-19 patients, 88% of patients showed either pure GGOs or consolidation or both [27] . The appearance of pure GGO is more common in the early stage of the disease, while the appearance of GGOs with consolidations is more frequently seen in the progressive stage [28] . Another common CT pattern associated with COVID-19 is the so-called \"Crazy Paving\" referring to thickened interlobular septa and intralobular interstitium superimposed on GGOs [26] . The crazy paving pattern is more commonly seen in the progressive stage of the disease [28] . The appearance of the crazy paving/consolidation patterns as a sign of disease progression/severity can help radiologists evaluate the disease stage. Interlobular septal thickening, air bronchogram, and vascular enlargement are other CT findings in COVID-19 patients [28] .",

[34] used a severity measure for COVID-19 patients, referred to as the CT score, that measures the extent of involvement based on a semi-quantitative scoring for each of the five lobes. The score ranges from 0 to 5, which is computed as shown in Table II . The overall CT score would be between 0 and 25, which is the sum of the lobar scores (some studies use a different scoring scale, which ends up to a CT score between 0 and 20 [30] ). Francone, et al. [34] conducted research on 130 COVID-19 patients and evaluated the correlation between CT score and disease severity. They showed that the CT score is strongly correlated with the COVID-19 clinical stage and severity. For patients in severe or critical categories, CT score is significantly higher than patients in the mild category [34] . CT score greater than 18 (out of 25) can be used as a predictor of mortality in COVID-19 patients [34] . CT score is highly correlated with patients' age.

CT score, together with patients' age, can be used to predict COVID-19 patients' death. 2) Chest Radiography (CXR): Some studies report that CXR images often show no lung infection in COVID-19 patients at early stages resulting in a low sensitivity of 69% for diagnosis of COVID-19 [35] . However, CXR is helpful for prediction of clinical outcome and for detection of COVID-19 in areas with limited access to reliable RT-PCR testing kits. The most commonly observed patterns in CXR of COVID-19 patients are GGOs and consolidations with bilateral peripheral distribution [35] . Pre-existence of medical conditions such as heart or other lung diseases will make the interpretation of CXR images challenging. Therefore, the interpretation of CXRs in younger patients would be more reliable and predictive. In Reference [36] , the authors developed a scoring approach for severity assessment and outcome prediction of COVID-19 patients between the ages of 21 to 50 years based on their CXR images. In their scoring system, each lung is divided into three zones. A binary score is then given to each zone based on the appearance/absence of COVID-19 abnormalities, and the total score would be in the range of 0-6. Their study on 338 patients demonstrates that there is a significant correlation between CXR score greater than two and hospital admission. They also reported that a CXR score greater than three could predict the need for intubation. Using lung Edema severity measure, referred to as RALE score, the authors in [37] quantify the extent of lung involvement and compute correlations with the risk of ICU admission for COVID-19 patients. Recent research works have demonstrated potentials of developing SP/DL-based models for grading the disease stage and performing outcome-prediction using CXR images.",

Due to its low cost, portability, ease of use, and being radiation-free, lung ultrasound can play a crucial role in the follow up and monitoring patients in the ICU.

However, comparing to classification models, limited number of research works have focused on segmentation models for COVID-19. Generally speaking, segmentation models (mostly developed based on CNNs) contain a contracting path (encoder) for extracting informative features from input images and an expanding path (decoder) for reconstructing the mask representing the regions of interest. Unlike classification models, typically, there are no fully connected layers in segmentation models. U-Net network [57] and its various extensions are the most commonly used architecture for segmentation of COVID-19 lesions. There are few works developed based on other successful segmentation networks. Some researchers have proposed innovative encoder-decoder networks for segmentation of COVID-19 lesions.

Adoption of pre-existing CNNs like DensNet and ResNet blocks in the encoder path of the U-Net will result in extracting higher resolution features from CT images [33] , [58] . Multi-scale feature fusion, i.e., integration of dilated convolutions with different dilation rates, can be added into U-Net-based segmentation models to help capture COVID-19 abnormalities in different scales [59] . The current focus is on increasing performance in segmenting the COVID-19 lesions.

Commercial U-Net-based soft-wares have also been used in some researches for quantification of COVID-19 abnormalities and determining the severity of the disease [32] , [ 2) Hand-Crafted Radiomics: Hand-crafted radiomics refers to the process of extracting several quantitative and semiquantitative features from the ROI with the ultimate goal of diagnosis/prediction. Compared to DL techniques, Handcrafted radiomics is less common in the problem of COVID-19 analysis, as it requires fine delineation of the infected regions and a prior knowledge of the types of the features to extract. Nevertheless, it benefits from more interpretability, as the features are engineered. As shown in Fig. 5 , Handcrafted radiomics, utilized in a few COVID-19 studies, follows a multi-step process, in the first of which infected regions are annotated. Consequently, several features are extracted from the segmented regions and fed to a conventional model, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), logistic regression, and decision tree, for making the final decision. Hand-crafted features cover a wide range of categories, including firstorder (basic intensity and shape-based features), second-order (texture features extracted from various matrices), and more advanced features such as those calculated from Fourier and Wavelet transforms. Intensity features [71] , shape-based [72] , and/or texture-based features, as well as other COVID-19 related features such as CT quantification metrics can be leveraged [58] , [69] . Radiomics in COVID-19 studies are mostly used in adverse outcome prediction models, explained in the next section. It is also possible to develop hybrid frameworks, where both hand-crafted and DL-based features are combined. Such methodology is adopted in Reference [70] by combining GAN generated features with pre-defined handcrafted ones. ",

[79] used CT features including lobe-wise quantification features and whole lung Radiomics together with patients' clinical information including age, sex, vital signs, and laboratory findings to predict the need for ICU admission in COVID-19 patients. They used a DL-based segmentation model to measure CT quantification features. Integrated input data from various types and resources are then fed into a random forest classifier for outcome prediction. Following this study, one can conclude that adding clinical information to CT features can improve the overall outcome prediction performance.",

Unlike most of the COVID-19 classification methods using CXR that incorporate the whole image at once, Oh et al. [106] extract several random patches from the input image and feed them individually to the DL model. The final decision is a majority voting over all the obtained outcomes. (ii) COVID-19 Classification via CT Scans: Unlike CXR images, CT scans are 3D in the sense that each patient is associated with several 2D slices. As a result, analyzing CT scans require specific strategies, the first of which is a slicelevel classification, where slices are treated independently with the goal of assigning labels to separate slices. Patientlevel classification, on the other hand, tries to make the final decision using all the available slices. examples of slice-level classification models, where target slices are manually selected to train the CNN model. At the test time, however, these studies, average over all the probabilities to form the patient-level classification. Therefore, the underlying studies can be considered as cross-sections of slice-level and patient-level classification, bringing us to the discussion in the next part, i.e., patient-level classification. \u2022 Patient-level Classification: Patient-level classification using CT scans requires a voting strategy to combine the slice-level outcomes. The voting mechanism is of particular importance as the whole CT volume cannot be typically processed at once.

Summing over the activation maps of the detected positive slices, consequently, results in the aforementioned volumetric score. It is worth mentioning that only activations above a pre-defined threshold are considered in the summation. The obtained COVID-19 score can also be considered as the extent of the disease in a patient's lungs. -Pooling Operations: For patient-level classification, one approach [105] is to combine different models (e.g., parallel CNNs) in a parallel architecture. Results from individual slices can then be aggregated through pooling operations. Similarly, Li et al. [93] incorporate parallel CNNs, results of which are aggregated through a max pooling operation. -Whole CT Volume: To leverage the information from all the CT scans and capture their relations, Wang et al. [111] feed their developed CNN model with the whole CT volume, which is concatenated with the segmented lung mask. The same strategy of feeding the whole CT volume is also used in Reference [115] . -Bayesian Merging: A Noisy-or Bayesian function is adopted in Reference [112] to combine outcomes of several infection patches. -RNN-based Merging: Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is another strategy to combine the slice-level information and consider the spatial relations. This group of models are discussed in Section IV-D4. -Multi-stage Frameworks: Designing a multi-stage framework is also a common patient-level classification approach. Mei et al. [89] , for instance, have designed a two stage workflow, where in the first stage abnormal slices are detected using a previous pre-trained pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) detection model. Top ten candidate slices are then fed to another CNN, in stage two, to identify slices with positive COVID-19. Final outcome is ultimately set as the average of slice-level prediction of a patient's ten most abnormal candidates. The same multi-stage strategy is followed in Reference [116] , with the difference that the CNNs are replaced with capsule networks, as described in Section IV-D4. 4) DL Architectures for COVID-19 Classification: Although different DL architectures are applicable to the task of image classification, in the COVID-19 scenario, discriminative models including CNNs, RNNs, and capsule networks are the most commonly used ones. These networks and how they are incorporated in COVID-19 classification studies are explained below.",

Beside focusing on designing layers of a CNN, another strategy is to feed the model with information other than the raw image. Such strategy is leveraged in Reference [112] , where the distance between the center of infection and pleura is concatenated with a fully-connected layer. This distance can contribute to a more accurate classification, as COVID-19 infection has a pleural distribution, partly distinguishing it from other diseases. Meng et al. [115] utilized patient's clinical factors, such as gender, age, and chronic disease history, as the additional information to be concatenated with the CNN's fully connected layer.

Collection of sufficient data for training robust COVID-19 models is challenging because: (i) COVID-19 is a new arising disease; (ii) Restrictions imposed to preserve patients' privacy, and; (iii) Health centers' strict data sharing protocols. On the other hand, despite the robustness of CNNs in hierarchically extracting high-value features from images, they cannot recognize the spatial relationships between those features. Due to various shapes and complex appearances of COVID-19 lesions, a large number of chest medical images are required to avoid over-flitting and ensure the model generalization. Data augmentation, transfer learning, multi-task learning, and the use of Capsules networks are some solutions to tackle these problems.",

Multitask learning is shown to be effective in reducing overfitting and can be further divided into two categories, i.e., (i) Hard parameter sharing, and; (ii) Soft parameter sharing. In the former category, different tasks explicitly share several layers. In the latter, however, separate models are trained for separate tasks and the parameters are encouraged to take close values. With this in mind, Amyar et al. [62] proposed a DL model to perform COVID-19 classification, segmentation and reconstruction at the same time, using the hard parameter sharing strategy. The model begins with an encoder to encode all CT scan into a latent space for subsequent analysis. For the segmentation and reconstruction tasks, the latent space is decoded into the original feature space. In the classification scenario, however, the latent space goes through a MLP for the final three-way classification. It is also worth mentioning that the encoder-decoder architecture follows the well-known U-Net design. While Mean Squared Error (MSE) is utilized for the reconstruction part, dice score and cross-entropy losses are adopted for segmentation and classification, respectively. The final loss is the sum over all the three losses.",

This is in contrast to most of other medical images, where motion artifact is rarely present. The artifacts in the COVID-19 images sometimes overlap with the main areas of infection, making the diagnosis/prognosis challenging even for experienced radiologists. To eliminate the effect of artifacts, most of the studies simply remove the noisy data from the dataset. This, however, reduces the generalizability and applicability of the model in clinical practice. An alternative solution is to approach advanced artifact reduction techniques, among which adaptive techniques are of higher capability as they can adjust and track the signal under noisy conditions.",

In a recent study by Tabatabaei et al. [124] , it is shown that obtained low-dose CT scans have high agreement with standard-dose ones, in terms of typical findings of COVID-19. More importantly, low-dose examinations are associated with less cancer risk, especially in young women. Fig. 10 shows the obtained CT scans for three different patients at three different dose levels, i.e., standard, low, and ultra low. According to this figure, although low and ultra low-dose images have more visible artifacts, they can still reveal the presence of COVID-19 infection. The artifacts, however, can hamper the effective training of the model. Furthermore, collecting a dataset of low-dose scans may not resolve this issue, as besides dose, other factors such as the patient's weight can influence the quality of the image, leading to a wide variety of possible artifacts. This calls for SP/DL models that can cope with images at different resolutions while providing the same level of diagnosis/prognosis performance.",

Regarding the black-box nature of the deep learning models, communicating explainable outcomes to the physicians is essential for clinical adoption of implemented DL models. Several explainability techniques are leveraged in COVID-19 studies, the simplest of which is to verify the outcomes with a radiologist. This approach is, however, timeconsuming and burdensome. Techniques, providing heat-maps of the most important regions of the input image, are also popular within the COVID-19 studies. One of the commonly used heat-map techniques is Class Activation Mapping (CAM), utilized in Reference [108] at different feature levels. Gradientweighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), visually depicting the deep model's decision, is also a CAM approach with the advantage of not requiring re-training. Grad-CAM outcome shows how the developed model pays more attention to the regions of infection of the chest radiographs in [102] , [109] . Saliency map has also shown interpretable outcomes within the COVID-19 studies [108] .",

Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs), U-Net++, and V-Net are some examples of successful segmentation networks that have been used as a base model for developing COVID-19 segmentation networks. (iii) Innovative COVID-19 Specific Encoder-Decoders: Some studies have developed innovative models for the segmentation of COVID-19 opacifications from scratch. Qiu, et al. [51] proposed a compact (light-weight) segmentation network based on 100 annotated CT slices from > 40 COVID-19 patients. In contrary to most of the segmentation models, which are large DL networks with millions of trainable parameters, their proposed model contains only 472 thousand parameters and achieved comparable results to its large-scale counterparts. Reference [50] developed a parallel partial decoder with edge and reverse attention modules to segment the COVID-19 lesions more precisely. Joint classification and segmentation networks, belonging to multi-task learning models, can enhance the performance of both segmentation and classification tasks by sharing the extracted features [61], [62]. Finally, segmentation models without use of labeled data can be developed [120] for distinguishing COVID-19 areas of infections. More specifically, random shape, noise generation, and image filtering operations can be used to synthesize COVID-19 lesions for inclusion into healthy chest CT scans and form training pairs.

They indicated that CT radiomics could be superior to radiologists' visual assessment in predicting COVID-19 patients' outcomes. \u2022 Length of Hospital Stay: Need for short or long-term hospital stay of COVID-19 patients can be estimated using regression or random forest models. In such scenarios, hand-crafted features such as first-order, secondorder, and/or shape features are extracted to predict the length of hospital stay of COVID-19 patients. Yue et al.[73] estimated the length of hospital stay in COVID-19 patients using logistic regression and random forest techniques.",

Below, we provide few examples of recent works using CXR or CT for severity assessment of COVID-19 infection: CT scans are also utilized by Li et al.[58] and divided into severe and non-severe groups.
