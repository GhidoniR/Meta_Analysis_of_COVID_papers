            "text": "The characteristics of social partners have long been hypothesized as influential in guiding group interactions. Understanding how demographic cues impact networks of creative collaborators is critical for elevating creative performances therein. We conducted a randomized experiment to investigate how the knowledge of peers' gender and racial identities distorts people's connection patterns and the resulting creative outcomes in a dynamic social network. Consistent with prior work, we found that creative inspiration links are primarily formed with top idea-generators. However, when gender and racial identities are known, not only is there (1) an increase of 82.03% in the odds of samegender connections to persist (but not for same-race connections), but (2) the semantic similarity of idea-sets stimulated by these connections also increase significantly compared to demographyagnostic networks, negatively impacting the outcomes of divergent creativity. We found that ideas tend to be significantly more homogeneous within demographic groups than between, taking away diversity-bonuses from similarity-based links and partly explaining the results. These insights can inform intelligent interventions to enhance network-wide creative performances.",

Creativity, although an individual strength, benefits strongly from interactions with others. Online/offline networks of creative collaborators, e.g., among researchers, designers, or marketers, can socially stimulate novel ideas in people 1 . The network dynamics of who seeks creative inspiration from whom can therefore critically impact the creative outcomes of a population. In such social settings, people inevitably and implicitly respond to the demographic cues of their peers 2-4 . Whether the knowledge of peers' demographic identities distorts the dynamics of the network ties and, consequently, the associated creative outcomes, remain important questions for both scientific and practical interests. While there exists a body of literature examining the diversity effects on creativity at individual and group levels 5-9 , such studies typically overlook the temporally dynamic nature of real social networks, limiting our scientific understanding of its implications. Previous work shows that the dynamic nature of social networks can influence human cooperation 10 , collective intelligence 11 , and the development of public speaking skills 12 , among other examples, but the effects in the creativity context remain unclear. From a practical perspective, it is desirable to elevate the creative capabilities of human networks. As automation takes away manual and repetitive jobs, the future of work will increasingly require offline/online ensembles of people to be adept in social-cognitive avenues of soft-skills such as creativity [13] [14] [15] . Understanding the effects of demographic cues on networked creativity is critical for designing informed interventions that can promote creative outcomes in both offline (e.g., large-scale creative teams) and online (e.g., in work-from-home settings, social media) dynamic networks alike.",

People from different demographic identities (e.g., gender/race) come with different concerns, perspectives, and life experiences. This can impact the knowledge domains they have access to, influencing the ideas they generate 5 . Furthermore, humans are known to be exceptionally adept at employing cues of skill/competence, success, prestige, age, health, and self-similarity to assess who most likely possess information useful to them, and form social links accordingly [16] [17] [18] [19] . Following this, it seems promising for (rational) humans OPEN to selectively form links with people from different demographic identities, so as to cash in on the diversity bonuses to generate novel ideas.",

It can then be argued that people might forego potential diversity bonuses in favor of self-similarity-based network connections. Previous work suggests that if multiple people draw inspirations from similar stimuli, then even their independently stimulated ideas can become similar to each other 21 . This way, homophily-guided network dynamics can limit the variety of ideas stimulated-leading to counter-productive outcomes in divergent creativity 22 . An implicit conflict thus results from the trade-off between the diversity bonus and homophily-choosing to affiliate with others based on selfsimilarity attenuates creativity while the collective effect of group diversity enhances creativity.",

We therefore design and conduct a randomized controlled experiment within the virtual laboratory. Using a custom social-media-like web-interface for the interactions, we are able to unambiguously track creative stimulation of ideas in a dynamic social network, while the challenges of ensuring an unconfounded exposure to demographic cues are overcome with the use of avatars.",

However, in the treatment condition, the egos were additionally shown the demographic information (gender and race) of their followee alters using avatars. If the egos got inspired with new alternate use ideas on the same object, they could add those ideas to their own lists (turn-2). Then, the egos were shown the ideas of all 6 alters, which they rated on novelty. Finally, they were allowed to optionally follow/unfollow alters to have an updated list of 2 followee alters each. In turn-2 of the following round, they were shown the ideas of their newly chosen alters ( Fig. 1 ; \"Methods\" section). Importantly, the only difference between the two conditions was that the treatment egos had access to the gender and race cues of the alters. Thus, any difference in the connectivity dynamics and network-level creative outcomes between the two conditions can be attributed to the availability of demographic cues. The bipartite network used as the initial configuration. Pre-recorded ideas of the alters were shown to the egos of both study conditions. Each ego was connected to 2 alters.

Intuition behind STERGMs. To capture the formation and persistence dynamics of the links, two separate models are fitted for the temporal networks of each study condition. The formation model tracks links that do not exist in time t, but exist in time t + 1 , e.g., the green link between ego e 1 and alter a 4 . The persistence model considers links that exist in both time instances, e.g., all grey links. Since the egos had to follow a constant number of two alters, the red link e 1 \u2212 a 2 needed to dissolve to allow the green link to form.

Crucially, in this design, the egos could dynamically update connections to alters every round, the links between ideas and their inspiration sources were unambiguously traceable, and the revelation of gender and race cues was controlled using avatars. This dynamic network approach is at a stark contrast to traditional diversity/group dynamics exploration setups, where the groups are typically treated as black boxes and the intra-group ties are seldom tracked explicitly 30 . Furthermore, our choice of a bipartite network structure ensured uniform stimuli-sets for the egos. However, like in all experiments, there were limitations, too. The unidirectional nature of the networks prohibited us from assessing the effects of natural bidirectional interaction settings. The avatars we used could potentially have Inter-ego semantic similarities under various conditions. Cosine similarities between the idea-sets of egos-pairs are shown across three sub-groups: ego-pairs who share 0, 1 and 2 common alters between them. With the increase in the number of common alters (i.e., increase in stimuli similarity), the inter-ego semantic similarity typically increases.

We nevertheless chose to use avatars over more realistic photos to standardize visual depictions and to remove confounding factors stemming from facial, personality, or other visual cues. We stopped collecting data for trial-2 when results consistent with trial-1 were achieved, thereby supporting our initial findings. However, future research should use a pre-specified sample size for trial-2 to provide a stronger replication of the trial-1 effects. Diversity, creativity and homophily are complex bodies of knowledge, each driven by multidimensional mechanisms. For instance, a large body of work has examined how exposure to gender and race cues can bias people's behavior in various settings. Descriptions of identical medical symptoms from men and women can be perceived differently by physicians 31 , even leading to cases where men patients are more comprehensively investigated than women patients with the same symptoms 32 . The perception of one's creativity can be biased based on identity as well: in their highly creative craft, male florists can be perceived as 'naturally' and 'truly' creative and thus held to higher regards than their female counterparts 3 . The power relations among various demographic identities have widely been documented and are known to dictate such biases. For example, the production of knowledge in academia can be racialized 33 , where the contributions by minorities can be systematically neglected 5, 33 . Such identity-based realities can influence the occurrence of homophilic ties in many domains, for example in engineering, where knowledge can be perceived to be highly accessible when women seek it from other women 2 .",

We found evidence that demographic cues can indeed bias the connectivity dynamics in creativity-centric social networks, and systematically influence the creative outcomes therein.

Previous literature suggests that such implicit priming can activate demography-specific schemas in people's memory 35 , potentially transferring to how one approaches a creative task 36 . Surface-level cues on gender or race can trigger the Social Categorization process 37 , whereby people differentiate themselves on the basis of demographic characteristics, e.g., race-based categorization can make the differences between White and Black more prominent. Our study revealed both gender and race cues simultaneously, which can trigger the Multiple Social Categorization process 24 . Under this process, shared identities can cut across the dichotomies of group identities. For example, if members belonging to Black and White categories are also female, then Black women and White women can be perceived as more similar compared to men 38 , reducing the race-based 'us' versus 'them' distinction. This process can partly explain why we observed a significant link persistence pattern in gender but not in race. Moreover, in the social science literature, both gender and race are known to be interwoven with questions of power and context. These identities often come with certain assumptions and stereotypes about social roles, including assumptions and stereotypes about knowledge: regarding who can know what and how the knowledge of different people are to be accessed, received, evaluated and prioritized [39] [40] [41] . Such assumptions and stereotypes could also have played a role in guiding the egos' rewiring decisions, as the same-gender connections became significantly stable across time.",

The egos in our study merely viewed the stimuli and formed no proper 'team' with the alters. Moreover, the ideas of the alters of various identities were equally accessible for the egos. This setting is rather similar to social media and academic networks of researchers, for example, where unidirectional and unreciprocated inspiration ties are common. Given this setting, the self-similarity based benefits, e.g., reduced conflict and greater psychological safety, were not on offer for the egos. We still saw a tendency of the egos to maintain links based on self-similarity of gender, thereby foregoing some values in diversity. It is not uncommon for people to report unreciprocated ties with creative others 46 ; and we find that such ties extend to homophily-guided dynamics as well. In behavioral economics, it is well known that humans are not always perfectly logical, rational and informed actors, and can often diverge from optimal 'rational' behavior (i.e., behavior that maximizes personal utility) in various social-psychological contexts 47 .

We found that in a creativity-centric social network, same-gender links persisted significantly. Such behavior was not observed if the gender and race cues were not available to the participants, everything else held constant. Moreover, we found people's ideas to be more homogeneous within demographic groups than between-reinforcing the intuition that diversity bonuses might www.nature.com/scientificreports/ get compromised if one systematically maintains connections based on demographic identity. We indeed found that in the presence of demographic cues, the inter-ego semantic similarity increased significantly compared to the control condition where no such cue was shown, thus hurting divergent creativity. These insights can help inform interventions/scaffolding in social systems where superior creative outcomes are sought after. For instance, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many teams are brainstorming using remotecollaboration tools. While many face-to-face interaction benefits may go missing in such platforms, there can be upsides on offer, too. Following our findings, masking/modifying people's identities online can potentially help to elevate network-level creative outcomes. In social media, people often follow highly creative peers for novel ideas. Their choices of who to follow can be biased by demographic considerations. Algorithmic interventions can then be made to help people diversify their creative stimulation sources. Such measures can proactively guard against the inter-follower semantic similarities to enhance network-wide creative performances. In our future work, we intend to explore more nuanced research questions about the differential effects of identity attributes in epistemic burden, impacts and privileges in creativity-centric social interactions. In addition, we intend to extend the scope of the study from the binary classification of gender and race to a multi-class perspective, using higher-resolution data from a larger set of gender and race categories.",

The avatars were used to ensure uniform visual depiction for all of the alters of the same demographic group, so as not to bias the egos by any facial, personality or other visual cues. The egos were instructed not to resubmit any of the alters' exact ideas, and told that only non-redundant ideas would contribute to their performance. They were also told that there will be a short test at the end of the study, where they will need to recall the ideas shown to them. This was to ensure that the participants paid attention to the stimuli ideas, which has been shown to positively impact ideation performances [51] [52] [53] [54] .
