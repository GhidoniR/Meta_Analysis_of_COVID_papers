However, these assays also provide quantitative data on cycle threshold (Ct) values, which are inversely related to the viral load and are not reported clinically. An advanced assay (e.g., whole genome sequencing) is required to interpret a recurrence-whether it is a relapse or a true reinfection. The effect of SARS-CoV-2 viral load on clinical outcomes and recurrence has not been extensively studied.",

Reinfections with respiratory viruses may occur as a result of a weakened or waning immune response (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus), reinfection with a different genotype/species (e.g., rhinoviruses), or the viruses' high variability (e.g., influenza virus). The immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is not well established and it is uncertain how long the antibody will prevent re-infection [11] . Moreover, vaccineinduced protective immunity may differ from natural immunity due to the immuneevasion strategies of wild-type viruses [12] . However, there is some evidence of persistence of neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 patients with natural infection for the first few months (~8 months) [13, 14] . The immune response following a natural infection is thought to be incomplete, and reinfections are likely [15] . One should not confuse relapse with \"long COVID\" which refers to symptoms of COVID-19 that continue after the typical convalescence period. According to some reports, about 10% of people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 had one or more symptoms for more than 12 weeks [16] .",

The specimens were transported to the laboratory in coolers within an hour of collection. RNA was extracted from the nasopharyngeal samples using QiaAmp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). A final volume of 60 microliters of RNA was eluted from a 140-microliter sample. RNA was tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) targeting ORF1ab-and N-gene specific primers and probes following the protocol of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (briefly as China CDC). A positive case was determined if the CT values of two targets (ORF1ab and N) were <37 in the same specimen. If CT values of any sample were 37\u221240 or a single target was positive, it was resampled and retested. If the CT values were still 37\u221240 and the amplification curves had obvious peaks, the sample was considered positive. We did repeat tests for all second-time positives to confirm that they were not false-positive cases. If a single target was positive in the repeat test, it was determined to be positive. The complete sequencing of positive isolates from the first and second episodes of each case was conducted using the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform. The RNA libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Gold Library kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions.

Most of the samples had high CT values (>30) indicating a low viral load. Whole genome sequencing is essential for determining true reinfections; however, our attempt failed due to low viral loads in collected NP swabs. Therefore, it is still unclear whether these were due to true reinfections or possible persistent low-level of infection sustained by viable viral particles or extra viral RNA.

The proportion of recurrent RNA positivity after recovering from COVID-19 in our study was lower than that reported by Camilla et al. (2020) in a metaanalysis, where the proportion was reported between 7 and 23% [17] . Several factors might explain the low percentage. Firstly, we followed a strict case definition for a patient to be included in our investigation with a combination of clinical symptoms, PCR positivity, at least a one-month gap between a negative test report and the reappearance of COVID-19 symptoms followed by the presence of viral RNA in a second PCR test. Secondly, we could not actively monitor and follow-up all first-time positive cases in person because of resource constraints, and the follow-up system depended on the passive reporting of symptoms by the staff to the clinic. As most employees worked from home, they were probably reluctant to report symptoms to the staff clinic in order to avoid social stigma [27] . Thus, we might have missed many mild to moderate symptomatic recurrences of COVID-19 among our study population. Thirdly, there is a high probability of asymptomatic reinfection [28] which was not captured in our surveillance system. Hence, the actual number of recurrences of SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity in our population may have been underestimated. Consensus criteria for deciding true SARS-CoV-2 reinfection should be set as new findings accumulate. Finally, our cohort did not include a collection of blood samples to describe the immunological profile that could allow us to evaluate the immune status of the cases.",

Some recent reports suggest that neutralizing antibodies against the virus remain relatively stable for several months after infection. In line with another case series [29] , it is not clear whether the virus can persist in some COVID-19 patients for a longer period and transmit to close contacts and later reappear as an apparent second illness with COVID-like symptoms. Therefore, we should still advise our staff to maintain social distance, wear masks and self-isolate as much as possible to prevent reinfection. Bangladesh has received 9 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, Covishield (AstraZeneca) from the Serum Institute of India and vaccinated a total of 3,682,152 individuals as of 7 March 2021 (Health Bulletin of DGHS, 7 March 2021). Given the global spread of new variants, it is yet to be explored whether mass vaccination against existing strains can reduce the incidence rate to sufficient levels required to halt the pandemic.",

Firstly, we tried to compare whole genome sequence data obtained from the first and second episodes from individual cases. However, only two complete sequences (with 99% coverage) were recovered from the 10 isolates (Supplementary Figure S1 ). Therefore, we could not determine whether the virus detected was identical or a different variant. Secondly, we could not conclude whether these cases were true reinfections or just relapsed cases. It is possible that the virus in the first episode diminished in the upper respiratory tract, became PCR negative, but was sustained in other parts of the body such as the pharynx, trachea, lungs, heart, kidneys, intestines, brain, genitals, or in body fluids such as the cerebrospinal fluid, semen and breast milk [30] . A systematic review showed that the virus could be sustained in other samples, such as the stool, for a longer period of time after the nasopharyngeal swab was negative [31] . Natural infection should, in theory, offer a degree of protection against future reinfection. However, in reality, this is not always achieved, given the differences in innate immunity and host genetics. Influenza vaccines that include previous variants may not protect against a new variant, so reinfection is likely. A lack of acquired immunity may partially explain the observed COVID-19 recurrence, but further immunogenetic studies examining innate, acquired and concomitant immunity are required.",

The efficacy of such initiatives, however, is largely dependent on public willingness to cooperate and their perceptions of risk towards COVID-19 [32] . All our COVID-19 positive cases were well aware of the coronavirus disease: how it spreads and what preventive measures should ideally be maintained to minimize the risk. Our findings support a previous study conducted in ten countries, including Asia, which found that people who had personal and direct experience with COVID-19 had significantly higher risk perceptions [33] . Although our whole genome sequencing was inconclusive, all five cases believed their second episode of the illness was reinfection because their sufferings were identical to (or even worse than) the first. Epidemiologically, they had the potential exposures before the second episode, and clinically their signs and symptoms were also compatible with COVID-19 infection.",
