In 2018, an estimated 1 in 9 Americans were food insecure, equating to over 37 million Americans, including more than 11 million children (Hunger and Health 2017) . Effective responses to FNI must address the overlapping challenges posed by the social determinants of health (USDA 2019; Healthy People 2020). According to Bacon and Baker (2017) , food banks served an estimated of 46 million people in the U.S in 2015. Although the vast majority of food and nutrition insecure people live in the developing world, the study further shows that increasing number of individuals continue to rely on private food assistance in the US, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and other high-income countries. In order to foster global nutrition security and global health, especially in other developing countries in the global south, the World Food Program (WFP), works with governments and partners to help vulnerable groups, such as women, children, and people receiving treatment for HIV and tuberculosis, access nutritious diets (WFP 2019). Some of the WFP programs which are aimed at promoting global nutrition and health include distributing Specialized Nutritious Foods, fortifying staples, designing and implementing school feeding and enabling dietary diversification. Food and nutrition insecurity (FNI) do not exist in isolation in the sense that low-income families are affected by multiple challenges such as social isolation, low wages, high medical costs, housing shortage, chronic health problems, and illiteracy. Taken together, these challenges and similar ones are important social determinants of health. Thus, effective responses to FNI must address the overlapping challenges posed by the social determinants of health (USDA 2019; Healthy People 2020).",

            "text": "According to FAO (2010) , CSA involves agriculture that sustainably increases productivity and resilience (adaptation), reduces/removes GHGs (mitigation), and enhances achievement of national food security and development goals. From the perspective of the Africa CSA Alliance, CSA offers triple wins, which include: significant potential to enhance food and nutrition security for all people at all times, taking account of the need for adaptation in response to current and near-term effects of climate change and, where in the interests of smallholder farmers, mitigation to reduce the future threats to global food security. A bulk of the academic and policy literature has focused primarily on the effects of climate change on agricultural productivity. 2 In other words, a few studies have been conducted to date specifically focusing on climate change and understanding its impact pathway in addressing mal-and undernutrition challenges in Africa. In most analysis, socioeconomic impacts hit agricultural sectors disproportionately hard, as many conflicts are fought in rural areas and targeting agricultural assets such as land. Domestic and foreign private investments in land are some of the root causes of violence, and the conflict over land increased competition for land, thereby affecting women's access and communal nutrition outcomes. Though conflicts over land result in undernutrition, few studies have also documented a reverse causal link in which socioeconomic and political grievances trigger conflict. Though emphasizing food security at the expense of food sovereignty and food self-sufficiency, the Principles for Responsible Agricultural Investment (RAI) anticipate that investment agreements could include \"call options,\" which can prevent exit of unacceptably large food volumes from the country when specific market conditions occur (Schutter 2011) . Further, the literature is replete with accounts of the adverse impacts of deforestation on the economic growth in Africa. For instance, Sierra Leone faces several challenges as it embarks on the process of ensuring economic growth following years of civil unrest. Extraction, deforestation, and land degradation are on the increase and in some instances, this has been attributed to the lack of effective policies and the inability to enforce those in existence. The rate of deforestation has increased by 7.3% since the end of the civil war and years of engaging in these activities has reduced the country's forest cover by over 70%. With these statistics and the various development processes going on in the country, it is of utmost importance to understand the factors that influence the rate of deforestation and provide informed advice that will assist policy makers to avert the imminent socioeconomic and environmental catastrophe.",

There has been increasing evidence of widespread land acquisition for agro-fuels production in collaboration with governments in a broad selection of Sub-Saharan African countries. Deininger (2011) noted that between January 2008 and April 2010, about four million hectares of average annual global agricultural lands were expanded. Friis and Reenberg (2010) found the evidence that land deals (sale or long-term leases totaling between 51 and 63 million hectares, roughly the size of France) had been finalized or were in negotiation in Sub-Saharan Africa alone. Though, land investors are mainly governments of food insecure countries in the Middle East and Asia which invest in food production beyond their borders, it must, however, be repeatedly stressed that EU companies which are interested in agro-fuel production make up a significant proportion of these investments, with 31 agro-fuels related land deals in 2009-2010 in Madagascar and Ethiopia alone (ibid.). Indeed, in 2012, the International Land Coalition reported that three quarters of land deals in developing countries between 2000 and 2012 were for biofuels production (Anseeuw et al. 2012) .

In other words, integration of customary land governance with formal legal land frameworks may hold the key to land negotiations that protect land rights and promote commercial investment (FAO 2010). Further, contrasting government policies to address wide disparities in land access range from legislation to protect and expand protection of land rights to radical land distribution to smallholder farmers as well as moderate measures to protect land rights for marginal groups. In addition, formulating effective and successful decentralization of land institutions to district and local levels or establishing program network between land management and poverty reduction initiatives will facilitate a process of strengthening the sustainability of land interventions (ILC 2009).",

They are essentially major contributors to activities on our planet. Our forest and trees are however being depleted at alarmingly high rates. Achieving short-term economic benefits has been at the center as to why countries engage in deforestation. Forests are often cleared for construction purposes as urbanization increases and the need for more land area increases and trees become a source of fuel for many. Another major reason often cited for deforestation is the need to expand agricultural activities. All these are carried out with little or no regard for the environmental impact, the health hazards, the social implications, and ultimately the long-run economic effects. Embarking on infrastructure development also tends to lead governments to resort to deforestation and this has also been the case in Sierra Leone.",

Some models on the other hand, use the preference for subsistence-type farming to explain the decision of farmers to engage in deforestation. These models maintain that once farmers have satisfied their minimum consumption level, they will choose leisure over more land for production. In such instances, increased demand for agricultural products will not have an increasing effect on the rate of deforestation. The rationale behind this is that with higher prices, farmers are able to make enough to meet their basic consumption needs without having to increase production. Angelsen (1999) assuming this subsistence behavior reveals that deforestation decreases when agricultural prices rise.",

Every day, Africans become poor and food insecure, forcing them to make difficult food choices and struggling with hunger as an epidemic amid the COVID-19 pandemic. By educating ourselves about these issues, we can collaborate to eliminate hunger boldly and confidently in our communities. There is an increasing role for non-governmental and community development organizations toward awareness creation as well as offering coordinated support to community residents. This support should provide food to residents who are in need. However, these NGOs' services delivery impact could be enhanced with the selected nutrition and sustainable agriculture policy interventions are implemented. The nutrition and sustainable agriculture research intervention or model which is being proposed in this paper is a community food and nutrition needs assessment and sustainable agriculture (CFNNASA) intervention, which will influence how CSA, nutrition and agri-food outcomes are evolving and the challenges inherent in measuring nutrition outcomes from a broad food distribution, environmental awareness, and health services research perspectives. Within this proposed model, the nutrition and sustainable agri-food policy research center will investigate questions like measuring what happens to the food once it reaches the household? Is the food consumed? And by whom? by embarking on longitudinal health profile of patients that have utilized food distribution programs toward bolstering the rationale for the collaborative initiative. The proposed research center will also advocate for evidence-based policies that encourage healthier eating, and improved health.",

Thus, in collaboration with research center, community health center will offer three-pronged approach to addressing FNI: mobile market, screening, and a tool kit. After implementing the model for a year or two, the research center will use randomized controlled trials to test its impact on the nutritional outcomes of specific low-income population will inform whether effective food distribution directly affect outcomes. Most importantly, it will increase accessibility of locally produced fresh fruits and vegetables, increase consumption of locally produced fresh fruits and vegetables among low-income residents, and implement a standardized system for scaling, implementing, and evaluating the impact of its program.

Thus, since the NGO may have limited relationship capacity with the community and the population that it serves, and also lack direct control over the distribution of food, research center could adopt a geographic information systems (GIS) to assess how well food and nutrition assistance programs are addressing proximity dimensions of access in serving food insecure populations in the community.
