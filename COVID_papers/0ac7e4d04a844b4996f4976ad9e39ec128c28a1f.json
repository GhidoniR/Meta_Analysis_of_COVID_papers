Vaccination may be the most effective way to prevent and control the spread of the virus. The safety of vaccines is the focus of preclinical research, and the repeated dose toxicity test is the key safety test to evaluate the vaccine before clinical trials. The purpose of this study was (i) to observe the toxicity and severity of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Vero cells) in rodent Sprague Dawley rats after multiple intramuscular injections under the premise of Good Laboratory Practice principles and (ii) to provide a basis for the formulation of a clinical trial scheme. The results showed that all animals in the experimental group were in good condition, no regular changes related to the vaccine were found in the detection of various toxicological indexes, and no noticeable stimulating reaction related to the vaccine was found in the injected local tissues. The neutralizing antibodies in the low-and high-dose vaccine groups began to appear 14 days after the last administration. In the negative control group, no neutralizing antibodies were observed from the administration period to the recovery period. Therefore, the repeated administration toxicity test of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Vero cells) in Sprague Dawley rats showed no obvious toxic reaction. It was preliminarily confirmed that the vaccine can stimulate production of neutralizing antibodies and is safe in Sprague J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Dawley rats.

The safety of vaccines is the focus of 40 preclinical research, and the repeated dose toxicity test is the key safety 41 test to evaluate the vaccine before clinical trials. The purpose of this 42 study was (i) to observe the toxicity and severity of an inactivated 43 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Vero cells) in rodent Sprague Dawley rats after 44 multiple intramuscular injections under the premise of Good Laboratory 45 Practice principles and (ii) to provide a basis for the formulation of a 46 clinical trial scheme. The results showed that all animals in the 47 experimental group were in good condition, no regular changes related to 48 the vaccine were found in the detection of various toxicological indexes, 49 and no noticeable stimulating reaction related to the vaccine was found in 50 the injected local tissues. The neutralizing antibodies in the low-and 51 high-dose vaccine groups began to appear 14 days after the last 52 administration. In the negative control group, no neutralizing antibodies 53 were observed from the administration period to the recovery period. 54 Therefore, the repeated administration toxicity test of the inactivated 55 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Vero cells) in Sprague Dawley rats showed no 56 obvious toxic reaction. It was preliminarily confirmed that the vaccine 57 can stimulate production of neutralizing antibodies and is safe 2020, the latest research results revealed that 2019-nCoV 79 is highly infectious and its transmission is difficult to detect (Hao et al., 80 2020). Due to these features, cases of 2019-nCoV infection, especially 81 asymptomatic ones, are not easy to find; hence, the virus easily spread 82 globally and in medical institutions. Even if the virus can be completely 83 eliminated from the population, the viral transmission mechanism from 84 host to human remains unclear, and there is a risk of re-outbreak or 85 periodic epidemics (Zhao et al., 2020). Vaccination may be the most 86 effective method to prevent and control the epidemic. Since China has 87 published the 2019-nCoV genome sequence, China, the United States, 88 Britain, Canada, Australia, and many vaccine companies have been 89 working on developing a COVID-19 vaccine. A SARS-CoV-(i) direct damage to the body caused by toxic components, 98 (ii) the immune-related toxicity caused by the induced immune system, 99 and (iii) the toxicity caused by pollutants and residual impurities. Since 100 the vaccine induces the immune system to produce antibodies and/or 101 effector T cells, the most important potential toxicity comes from the 102 toxicity related to the immune system. 103 Preclinical safety evaluation is one of the important phases in 104 vaccine development. Its goal is to predict the safety of clinical 105 application by detecting the potential toxicity of new vaccines in animals, 106 reduce the risks taken by clinical trial subjects and clinical users, and 107 provide a basis for the formulation of clinical trial protocols (Forster, 108 2012; Liu and Li, 2018; Sun et al., 2012",

Most pathological results of rats 429 in each group, no matter at 3 or 14 days after the last administration, were 430 normal. Figure 4 showed that there were no obvious histopathological 431 changes in main organs including lung, liver, kidney and heart in each 432 group. Meanwhile, muscles at injection site were also pathologically 433 examined. No obvious pathological changes were found in each group the most effective and economical means to prevent 438 and control many infectious diseases(Iwasaki and Omer, 2020; Leidner et 439 al., 2019). Because vaccines are mainly used for immunization of healthy 440 people, the safety requirements of vaccines should be much higher than 441 those of therapeutic drugs. Pre-clinical safety evaluation is one of the 442 important phases in the development of new vaccines. However, due to 443 the sudden outbreak, the pre-clinical safety evaluation of the 444 SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine remains to be conducted. How to 445 evaluate the safety of the vaccine is also under continuous exploration. 446 It is generally considered that the vaccination dose is small and the 447 adverse reactions are mild. According to the WHO guidelines on vaccine 448 toxicology studies, no matter what animal model is used, it is 449 recommended to give at least the dose that one person would 450 to achieve the best immune response in animals, and that 454 long-term toxicity tests can be conducted directly using the high dose (per 455 person) proposed in clinical trials(CDE, 2008). In the current study, the 456 candidate dose of the SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine for clinical trialpre-clinical safety evaluation of vaccine products, a single 461 animal species should be used to study the toxicity of repeated 462 administration(CDE, 2008). The Sprague Dawley rats used in this study 463 are the most commonly used rodents in vaccines general toxicity 464 studies(Mancebo et al., 2012; Sifontes-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2009; Stokes et 465 al., 2020). The background information of this family of animals is 466 abundant, and the supply of animals is sufficient. The candidate vaccine 467 was planned to apply for adults over 18 years old. Therefore, the choice 468 of Sprague Dawley rats on 5-6 weeks, which reached sexual maturity, 469 were more reasonable in repeated dose toxicity study. In neutralizing 470 antibody testing experiment, both low-dose vaccine group and the 471 high-dose vaccine group could be detected at 14 days after the first 472 administration. By 14 days after the second vaccination, the neutralizing 473 antibodies were positive in all vaccinated groups. From 14 days after the 474 second dose to 14 days after the third dose, the levels of neutralizing 475 antibodies of these two groups continued to rise, and this trend remained 476 until 14 days after the fourth administration, showing that the 477 SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine (Vero cells) could stimulate Sprague 478 possible were tested in the repeated dose toxicity study. One 487 of the potential toxicity of vaccines comes from immune system-related 488 toxicity, including hypersensitivity reactions and autoimmunity. 489 Autoimmunity is the main research content of immunotoxicology \uff0c 490 especially for adjuvanted vaccines(Agmon-Levin et al., 2009; 491 Batista-Duharte et al., 2014). So far, only a few autoimmune diseases 492 caused by vaccine immunization have been reported, such as Guillain-493 Barr\u00e9 syndrome, caused by influenza vaccination in the United States Schonberger et al., 1979). However, the detailed mechanism is still not 495 fully understood. From the perspective of strict regulation, 496 product-related immunotoxicological evaluation should be carried out 497 during the safety evaluation of new vaccines before clinical trials. Serum 498 autoantibodies have been widely used for the detection of specific 499 autoimmune diseases (Descotes, 2000; Verdier et al., 1997), although the 500 association between autoantibody levels and the development and 501 severity of autoimmune diseases is not fully established. In this study, no 502 antinuclear antibodies were detected in rats after repeated immunization 503 with the SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine. These results indicate that the 504 experimental vaccine might have a low risk of causing an autoimmune 505 response. Meanwhile, the results of the present study showed that after 506 cells, play a key role in antiviral immunity(Yang et al., 2018), 517 the level of cellular immunity is another important consideration. In this 518 study, the detection of rat CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was carried out, and 519 the ratio of both kinds of cells had not changed significantly (Figure S1). 520 At the same time, immune cells (including lymphocytes, mononuclear 521 phagocytes, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, and platelets) in the 522 blood did not increase or decrease after the first dose or the last dose or 523 during the recovery period. It indicated that the vaccine had no obvious 524 effect on lymphocytes and there was no infectious antigen in inactivated 525 vaccines, which would attack antigen presenting cells to produce 526 cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ T cells)(Yang et al., 2018). 527 Although there was a difference in serum ALP levels between the 528 negative control group and the solvent control group 3 days after the first 529 administration of the vaccine (P < 0.05), it returned to the normal value 3 530 and 14 days after the last administration, and there was no dose-response 531 relationship. ALP was one of indicators related with liver function, 532 especially serum ALP which was hepatic origin. The increase of ALP 533 usually associated with liver lesions. However, other indexes related to 534 . Only one indicator change was not clinically 538 significant. Meanwhile, the level of ALP in this study was normal 539 comparing with other Sprague Dawley rats in toxic studies(Mancebo et 540 al., 2012; Mary L.A. Giknis, 2006; Sifontes-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2009). No 541 abnormality was found in pathological examination of solvent control 542 group at 3 days after first administration as well. Therefore, it suggested 543 that the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has no obvious hepatotoxicity 544 in Sprague Dawley rats. At 3 and 14 days after the last administration, the 545 results of urine routine examination showed that occult blood appeared in 546 all groups, and the index was on the high side. In the comparative 547 analysis with the negative control group, considering that the change of 548 the index was not related to the vaccine, the 4-h urine content is the most 549 ideal in the determination of various indicators of urine. Because the 550 amount of urine is greatly affected by the amount of drinking water, 551 especially for experimental animals, the retention process of collecting 552 4-h urine is relatively complex. Single measurements of the 553 concentrations of substances in random urine samples give an incomplete 554 view of the real situation. There was no statistically significant difference 555 in other urine indicators between the two groups. In addition, urea 556 nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (CREA) levels were normal. Although a 557 small number of animals (5/120) showed glomerular atrophy, only a 558 small number of local changes were not obvious, and the incidence rate 559 was low. In this study, the occurrence of renal lesions was not associated 560 with certain doses or groups. We speculate that the lesions were 561 spontaneous changes in the kidney and were due to accidental events 562 days after the last administration showed some mild inflammatory 566 symptoms, but its tissue structure was complete, clear, and no large area 567 of cell injury was observed. These lesions did not have significant 568 temporal differences and group distribution specificity, and there was no 569 significant gender difference, nor was it a specific change of a certain 570 type of disease. In compilation of histopathological findings in 4-26-week 571 old Sprague Dawley rats compiled by Charles River Laboratory, the 572 incidence of pathological changes in heart, liver, kidney and lung was 573 higher than other organs no matter in male or female rats. All rats 574 reported in this compilation were from 34 toxicity studies conducted in 575 different laboratories(Mary L.A. Giknis, 2012). Also, it has been shown 576 that Sprague Dawley rats often develop spontaneous diseases with 577 chronic inflammation as the main lesion, including chronic interstitial 578 pneumonia or liver and cardiac focal necrosis (Noto et al., 1998; Weber et 579 al., 2011). Spontaneous renal lesions in rats are dominated by tubular 580 lesions, including dilation of renal tubules, protein cast, tubular atrophy, 581 pigmentation, and calcium deposition. The incidence increases with age 582 and may be associated with many factors such as nutrition (Chandra and Hannerz et al., 1989). The indicators related to relevant 584 organs function in the same batch were normal. Therefore, the above 585 lesions were probably spontaneous or occasional lesions in Sprague 586 Dawley rats, and some of them may be physical injuries caused by the 587 operation processes. They have no toxic pathological significance, and no 588 dose-effect-related lesions and target organs have been found. seven different species of animals. Sprague Dawley rats were 593 used in this study for repeated dose study as well. After different doses 594 administration and 2-week recovery, there was no obvious systemic 595 toxicity observed in rats(Wang et al., 2020). Similar to the study above, 596 repeated administration of high-dose (1.5 person dosages) SARS-CoV-2 597 inactivated vaccine did not cause damage to the animals' immune system, 598 and no obvious dose-response histopathological changes were seen in 599 various tissues and organs. Most importantly, in both the low-dose 600 vaccine group (1 person dosage) and the high-dose vaccine group 601 (1.5person dosages), no serious pathological changes and abnormal 602 clinical indicators, predicting systemic toxicity, were found. There was no 603 obvious dose-response change where found in SARS-CoV-2 viral target 604 organ: the lungs and bronchi. The vaccine was preliminarily confirmed to 605 have good safety, providing an experimental basis for further clinical 606 trials and a reference framework for related follow-up research. and Caixing Zhang participated in this work.

            "text": "). The repeated administration 109 toxicity test is a critical safety test for evaluating vaccines before clinical110 trials. When applying for an investigational new drug permit for the novel 111 coronavirus vaccine, it is necessary to vaccinate at least one related 112 animal species with one more repeat than the planned clinical trial. In 113 view of the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the wide range of 114 transmission, more risks and challenges may be faced. In order to obtain 115 more comprehensive virus data and understand the cumulative toxicity 116 that may be caused by repeated clinical injections, in this study we 117 performed the repeated administration toxicity test for the SARS-CoV-2 118 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f inactivated vaccine in animals and carried out necessary preclinical 119 toxicological studies for clinical trials and marketing of the SARS-CoV-2 All SARS-CoV-2 virus strains used in this work were isolated from 124 hospitalized patients including domestic and foreign patients with 125 confirmed COVID-19 in Yunnan Hospital of Infectious Diseases from January to May 2020. A strain with a D614G mutation in the S protein 127 was isolated from a pediatric patient who had returned from the U.S. to 128 their hometown and was identified as being infected with SARS-CoV-2 129 through clinical diagnosis and q-RT-PCR in March 2020. The virus was 130 proliferated in Vero cells (WHO) and was titrated with a microtitration 131 assay. Vero cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 132 (DMEM; Corning, NY, USA) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FCS; HyClone, Logan, USA). The SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine was developed by the Institute of Medical Biology (IMB), Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS). Briefly, the virus strain, named KMS-1 (GenBank No: MT226610.1), was 137 inoculated into Vero cells for production in an environment that met the 138 BSL requirements. The harvested viruses were inactivated by 139 formaldehyde (v:v=1:4000) for 48 h to lyse the viral membrane, purified 140 via chromatography and concentrated. A second inactivation with 141 beta-propiolactone (v:v=1:2000) was performed to destroy the viral 142 genomic structure, followed by a second purification and concentration 143 using the same protocol. The vaccine stock was evaluated using various 144 quality indexes, including antigen content, immunogenicity, sterility and 145 residue testing. The viral antigen content was measured via ELISA. The 146 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f vaccine contained 100 or 150 U of inactivated viral antigen adsorbed to 147 0.25 mg of Al(OH)3 adjuvant and suspended in 0.5 ml of buffered saline 148 for each dose. The placebo contained only the same amount of Al(OH)3 Animals: Specific Pathogen Free Sprague Dawley rats, 6-8 weeks 151 old; animal weight range when purchased: female, 150.8-192.7 g; male, 152 158.7-203.5 g; and the weight variance of the animals in the same batch 153 did not exceed 20% of the average weight. Animals were provided by Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd., production 155 license No. SCXK (Jing) 2016-0006.
