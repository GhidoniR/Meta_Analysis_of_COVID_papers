            "text": "Profound T-cell lymphopenia is the hallmark of severe . T-cell proliferation is telomere length (TL)-dependent and telomeres shorten with age. Older Covid-19 patients, we hypothesize, are therefore at a higher risk of having TL-dependent lymphopenia. We measured TL by the novel Telomere Shortest Length Assay (TeSLA), and by Southern blotting of the terminal restriction fragments (SB) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 17 Covid-19 and 21 non-Covid-19 patients, aged 87 \u00b1 8 (mean \u00b1 SD) and 87 \u00b1 9 years, respectively. TeSLA tallies and measures single telomeres, including short telomeres undetected by SB. Such telomeres are relevant to TL-mediated biological processes, including cell viability and senescence. TeSLA yields two key metrics: the proportion of telomeres with different lengths (expressed in %), and their mean, TeSLA mTL (expressed in kb). Lymphocyte count (10 9 /L) was 0.91 \u00b1 0.42 in Covid-19 patients and 1.50 \u00b1 0.50 in non-Covid-19 patients (P < 0.001). In Covid-19 patients, but not in non-Covid-19 patients, lymphocyte count was inversely correlated with the proportion of telomeres shorter than 2 kb (P = 0.005) and positively correlated with TeSLA mTL (P = 0.03). Lymphocyte count was not significantly correlated with SB mTL in either Covid-19 or non-Covid-19 patients. We propose that compromised TL-dependent T-cell proliferative response, driven by short telomere in the TL distribution, contributes to Covid-19 lymphopenia among old adults. We infer that infection with SARS-CoV-2 uncovers the limits of the TL reserves of older persons.",

This process might partially explain the increased severity and fatality of Covid-19 in seniors, 7 because TL shortens with age .8 Epidemiologic studies have used leukocyte TL (LTL) as a proxy for an individual's TL in different leukocyte lineages and somatic cells. This approach is justified, since the interindividual variation in TL far exceeds TL differences among leukocyte lineages and somatic cells within an individual. 9-11 These studies as well as more fundamental telomere research are based on the premise that telomeres experience attrition with somatic cell replication, a process ultimately generating short telomeres that signal the cellular machinery to stop replication. Such a signal is triggered, however, by the shortest telomeres -not the mean of the different lengths of telomeres in the nucleus. 12, 13 Almost all previous telomere studies A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 5 have employed techniques that generate data based on mean TL (mTL) rather than the shortest telomeres in DNA samples. In the present study, we employed a novel method coined the Telomeres Shortest Length Assay (TeSLA) that also measures and tallies short telomeres in the TL distribution. 14 This approach allowed us to test the relation between lymphocyte counts and short TL in patients with Covid-19, using a more direct and biologically meaningful parameter of short TL. We also quantified mTL by Southern blotting of the terminal restriction fragments (SB), 15 to facilitate comparison with a standard TL measurement method. Notably, we focused on older adults because of their comparatively shorter LTL 8 and susceptibility to severe Covid-19. 14, 15 Although these two methodologies of TL measurements are correlated (see below and under Supplemental Information), they do not produce identical information. The SB method is the 'gold standard' of TL measurements against which the validity of all other techniques is judged, but it was designed to measure the mean length of the 92 telomeres of the q and p arms of the 23 human chromosome pairs (SB mTL). SB typically generates a weak signal for TLs below 3 kilobases (kb) and is therefore usually applied to a range of 3 to 20 kb ( Figure S1 ). TeSLA, in contrast, generates signals for single telomeres in the TL distribution, and covers a TL range from 18 kb to below 0.8 kb ( Figure   S1 ). TeSLA measurements yield two key metrics: (a) the proportion of short telomeres (expressed in %) with different TL thresholds for which there is as yet no criterion based on ultimate end points, and (b) TeSLA mTL (in kb), which is the mean TL of the telomeres captured by TeSLA measurements.",

The primary hypothesis we tested focused on the correlation of the lymphocyte count (dependent variable) with the proportion of telomeres < 2 kb among Covid-19 patients. We also used two alternative thresholds, i.e., < 3 kb and < 1.6 kb, to ascertain that results did not reflect an arbitrary choice of threshold (this yielded the same conclusions, results not shown). We next tested the correlation between lymphocyte count and TeSLA mTL and SB mTL. Although SB mTL and TeSLA mTL are correlated ( Figure S2A ), the proportions of short telomeres, e.g., < 2 kb, correlate better with TeSLA mTL ( Figure S2B ) than with SB mTL ( Figure S2C ). Finally, we performed these analyses in non-Covid-19 patients, and compared correlations with those among Covid-19 patients.",

            "text": "Three well-established findings form the foundation for our model. First, the plummeting number of T-cells is the principal cause of Covid-19 lymphopenia. 1-3 Second, TL parameters in PBMCs largely reflect TL parameters in all leukocyte lineages, including T-cells. 10 Third, the shortest telomeres in the TL distribution-which can be detected by TeSLA-are better indicators than mTL of telomere-related biological endpoints, including cell viability. 12, 13 We note, however, that thresholds of telomeres shorter than a finite value (e.g. < 3 kb, < 2 kb, < 1.6 kb) are arbitrary. We regard these thresholds as probabilities rather than distinct TL cutoffs, i.e., the likelihood of a biological endpoint such as cessation of replication, increases as cell telomeres approach these thresholds. The T-cell blood pool is a component of the T-cell hierarchy, whose structure and composition are complex and change with age. 18, 19 For simplicity, we consider the T-cell blood pool as a homogeneous entity (Figure 2 ). In this highly simplified scenario, the size of the T-cell blood pool reflects the balance between T-cell depletion -due to senescence/death and sequestration out of the circulation -and T-cell repletion through proliferation. As T-cell proliferation is TL-dependent, 5,6 individuals with extremely short telomeres because of rare detrimental mutations are unable to maintain their T-cell blood pool. 20 In the general population, however, TL variation shows no relation with lymphocyte count, 21 presumably because of the low turnover of T cells 22 (Figure 2A ). This might not apply in the face of Covid-19, since rapid T-cell proliferation is probably critical for offsetting the development of, and recovery from Covid-19 lymphopenia. We note, however that the exact etiology of Covid-19 lymphopenia remains incomplete. 2 For instance, the 'vanishing' T cells from the circulation might reflect a massive inflammatory response that consists of 'recruitment' of T cells to engage SARS-CoV-2 in the lung and the vascular endothelium.",

Given the wide inter-individual TL variation in the general population, TL of some young adults in their 30s and 40s is as short as TL in older persons in their 70s and 80s. 8 These young adults, we propose, may be susceptible to Covid-19 lymphopenia despite their young age. In addition, some studies A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 11 suggest that that in response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, factors in the innate immune response suppress the T-cell response, explaining in part the plummeting number of T-cells in severe Covid-19, 28 However, these studies have not explained the propensity of older adults to have severe Covid-19 lymphopenia and die from the disease.",

Reverse causation, however, seems unlikely; a low lymphocyte count would not rapidly shorten TL in Covid-19 patients. Second, we build our model on T-cell TL dynamics, but measured TL in PBMCs. Although inter-individual differences in TL tend to outweigh differences in TL for cell types within an individual, [9] [10] [11] further insight and support for the hypothesis will be gained by isolating T cells and examining their TL parameters in Covid-19 patients. Third, the detection of the inverse correlation between lymphocyte count and the proportion of very short telomeres required use of TeSLA, a novel and expensive approach available in few laboratories worldwide.",

As TeSLA and SB results are correlated, we anticipate that the TL-Covid-19 connection we highlight might also be captured using SB measurements in larger cohorts. Fourth, we studied a small cohort of older persons of European ancestry, all surviving the disease for at least 15 days. This most vulnerable group to severe Covid-19 is not representative of the general population, but studying its members has provided the optimal setting to examine the TL-lymphopenia connection in this disease. 7 In addition, TL dynamics of hematopoietic cells are complex, poorly understood and partially contribute to Covid-19 severity and its clinical outcomes. M a n u s c r i p t 12 In conclusion, in a small study of older adults, we tested a model that links lymphopenia in older Covid-19 patients with PBMC TL parameters. Our findings show that comparatively short PBMC telomeres, as expressed in the shortest telomeres of the TL distribution, are associated with diminished lymphocyte count in older persons infected with SARS-CoV-2.

The other 21 non-Covid-19 patients were hospitalized for different reasons; they had negative RT-PCR the virus and no clinical or radiological findings consistent with Covid-19. We recorded lymphocyte count from the first blood sample collected after the RT-PCR confirmation of Covid-19 or admission blood sample in non-Covid-19 patients. Lymphocyte count was obtained after a complete blood count using an automated hematology analyzer SYSMEX XN-9100 on whole blood sample. Eighteen participants signed an informed consent approved by the COMITE DE PROTECTION DES PERSONNES (CPP) ILE DE France III. CPP File N\u00b0: Am8448-6-3765.
