Methods A total of 27 patients with unilateral stage 2 breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) were included in the study. Bilateral circumferential measurements were taken with a tape measure at different levels. Based on these measurements, limb volumes were determined by summing segment volumes derived from the truncated cone formula. Circumferential measurements and ultrasonographic evaluations (epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous fat thicknesses) were performed at 10 cm distal to the elbow crease. The Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (SWM), static and moving two-point discrimination, pressure pain threshold (PPT), and tactile localization tests were also applied at the same site. After an initial evaluation, all patients underwent CDP phase 1 program. All the evaluations were repeated at the end of the treatment period. Results Before CDP, affected sides had significantly higher values than the unaffected sides in terms of SWM (p < 0.001), static (p = 0.002) and moving (p = 0.011) two-point discrimination, PPT (p = 0.001), and tactile localization (p < 0.001) values. After CDP, SWM (p = 0.002), static (p = 0.009) and moving (p = 0.024) two-point discrimination, PPT (p = 0.014), and tactile localization (p < 0.001) values decreased significantly on the affected sides. Conclusion BCRL seems to reduce light touch, static and moving two-point discrimination, PPT, and tactile localization sensations, whereas CDP seems to improve these sensory perceptions in women with BCRL. Ultrasonographic measurements also appear to be promising for prompt and convenient follow-up in the management of BCRL.",

            "text": "With the therapeutic advances, the survival rates as well as certain long-term complications have increased among breast cancer survivors. For instance, breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is commonplace in musculoskeletal practice and has the potential to cause significant disability during daily activities [1] . Therefore, in addition to lymphedema, breast cancer patients might also suffer other conditions after surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy, such as neuropathy up to 30%, myofascial pain up to 44%, fatigue up to 94%, 20-40% upper body problems, and 18-54% functional limitations [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , which contribute to patients' particular complaints, such as arm pain, numbness, or feeling of heaviness [9, 10] . Women with lymphedema more frequently report pain and demonstrate bilateral impairments in shoulder range of motion, greater restrictions in upper limb activities and upper limb strength, and sensory disturbances compared to women without lymphedema [9, 11] . While there are several studies in the literature on physical, functional, and emotional problems in women with BCRL, the effects of lymphedema on sensory parameters have not been explored. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was twofold. First, we aimed to investigate if/how the presence of lymphedema (affected/unaffected sides) affects the ultrasonographic measurements of soft tissue layers and skin sensation. Secondly, we aimed to assess whether complex decongestive physiotherapy (CDP) has a favorable impact (pre-and post-treatment) on limb volume/circumference and, thus, soft tissue ultrasound measurements and sensory parameters. To this end, aside from circumferential measurements and sensory evaluations (light touch, static and moving two-point discrimination, pressure pain threshold, and tactile localization sensation perceptions), we also included ultrasonographic (i.e., morphological) evaluations of different layers of skin and subcutaneous tissues in this study.",

Considering the difference between the dominant and nondominant arm volume, a 3.3% volume correction was performed in women with dominant arm involvement [15] . The severity of lymphedema was determined by the difference between the calculated volumes of the affected and unaffected arms (moderate lymphedema: 250-500 ml difference; severe lymphedema: > 500 ml difference) [16] . In addition, bilateral circumferential measurements were made at 10 cm distal to the elbow crease (the level at which ultrasonographic measurements were made) [17] . Intra-and inter-rater reliability levels were found to be excellent for circumferential measurements (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC): 0.998 and 0.997, respectively) in patients with BCRL. Standard errors of measurements (SEM) were 0.13 cm (0.5%) for intra-rater assessment and 0.17 cm (0.7%) for inter-rater assessment of the forearm [18] .",

Epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous fat thicknesses were measured using plenty of gel and with minimum probe compression using the automatic calculation feature of the US device. Intra-and inter-rater ICC values were found to be excellent (0.95 and 0.99, respectively) for US measurements of the forearm in patients with BCRL [19] .",

During the sensory tests, the participants were seated with their forearms supinated and extended on the examination table. They were informed in detail about the tests before the assessments. The patients were asked to close eyes and turn the head towards the opposite side of the testing arm. On the last day of the 3 weeks of CDP, for each patient, the compression bandages were removed and, before the sensory measurements, the patients were asked to wash their arms, lie down, and rest for 30 min in order to reduce the effect of compression on sensory perception. As one of the most objective sensory tests [20, 21] , the Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments (SWMs) (North Coast Medical, Morgan Hill, CA, USA) were used to assess the tactile sensitivity of the upper extremities-on volar region of the forearm, 10 cm distal to the midpoint of the medial and lateral epicondyles. The tests were started with the smallest diameter monofilament and progressed successively with larger diameter monofilaments until the correct responses were obtained [20, 21] . Each monofilament was touched three times with 2-s intervals, and the patients were asked to say \"yes\" when they felt the monofilament on their skin.",

[9] evaluated light touch using SWM and vibration with a biothesiometer in breast cancer patients with or without lymphedema whereby the severity of lymphedema was mostly mild. It was determined that light touch (but not vibration) sensation was significantly decreased in patients with lymphedema as compared to those without. Using SWM, Civelek [29] found no difference between the affected and unaffected sides of the cases with mild lymphedema after breast cancer treatment. In contrast/addition to these aforementioned reports, several sensory tests (i.e., light touch, static and moving two-point discrimination, PPT, and tactile localization) were applied in our study and Concerning the possible mechanisms, it was reported that light touch sensation decreased as the mechanical properties of the skin (e.g., hardness, epidermal thickness, and stretch response) increased [30] . It is thought that the decrease in sensory perception of SWM, static and moving two-point discrimination, PPT, and tactile localization, together with epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous fat thicknesses, might be related to the decrease in the ability to activate afferent conduction. Increased soft tissue thickness can cause a greater distinction between the mechanoreceptors and the external stimuli and has a significant effect on afferent firing at the perceptual threshold. In addition, the transmission ability of the stimulus force applied to the skin to activate the mechanoreceptors may be affected by skin hardness and thickness [30] . In stage 2 lymphedema, the skin is hard and the godet test is also positive with strong pressure. Moreover, in stage 2 lymphedema, the extremity is enlarged and nerve endings possibly become responsible for a wider area. Therefore, this could be another reason for the decrease in sensation. Additionally, peripheral nerve entrapments associated with lymphedema or fibroblast infiltration might also be contributory as regards the eventual sensory disturbance [31] .",

Currently, it is the most effective and the gold standard conservative treatment for volume reduction in lymphedema [16, 32] . Auriol et al. [33] reported that skin elasticity increased and soft tissue thickness decreased after CDP. Keser and Esmer [34] examined the acute effects after one session of MLD and found that the PPT and pressure pain tolerance increased in healthy subjects. In our study, not only MLD but also all components of CDP were applied for 3 weeks. Additionally, to eliminate the effects of compression on sensation, evaluations were made 30 min after [35] . Edema reduction and possible/favorable changes in the skin histology might have contributed to the improvement in the sensory parameters. Moreover, components of CDP provide a high level of sensory inputs to the patients [36, 37] and they might have positively contributed as well. This study has some major limitations. First, sensory evaluations were acquired from a single region. Herein, since more than one sensory perception was preferred to be assessed in detail and as a high concentration of the subject is a prerequisite during the assessments, we have taken a single region to avoid distraction and inconvenience. Second, due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, both the number of patients who applied for lymphedema treatment and that of those who volunteered to participate in our study decreased significantly. Likewise, due to the insufficient number of patients, subgroup analysis either as regards different breast cancer treatments (e.g., surgical approaches, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy) which may also cause sensory deficits [38] or as regards the presence/absence of lymphedema was considered to be inappropriate. Therefore, further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted.",

Being aware that BCRL is commonplace in daily clinical practice and that sensory disturbances can expose these patients to injuries, it is noteworthy that relevant patients be treated with CDP not only for edema reduction but also to improve their sensory functions. There is definitely a need for future randomized controlled studies investigating sensory functions in breast cancer patients with or without lymphedema, also taking into account different cancer therapies they receive. Moreover, further studies with additional sensory evaluations at multiple sites and perhaps coupled with specific electrophysiological correlates are definitely awaited.",
