[4] [5] [6] [7] Coexisting hypoxia, electrolyte disarray, and the administration of arrhythmogenic medications (eg, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin) make it difficult to ascertain the direct and indirect contribution of COVID-19 on cardiac arrhythmias. A 58% increase in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the Lombardy region of Italy during the first 40 days of the COVID-19 pandemic raised concerns regarding the risk of arrhythmia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. 8 In the United States, a large single-center study of 700 patients demonstrated that admission to the intensive care unit was independently associated with a 10-fold increase in arrhythmia risk. 9 Although cardiac arrest was associated with in-hospital mortality, most were due to nonshockable rhythms, and incident AF, bradycardia, and nonsustained VT were not associated with mortality. 8 In this global case series, including 29 institutions across 4 continents, 12 countries, and 28 cities (Figure,  Table 1 ), we aimed to survey the experiences of institutions from multiple continents to better understand the type of arrhythmias associated with COVID-19 infection, as well as global differences in modulations of routine electrophysiology practice due to the pandemic. Patient care of COVID-19 infection has varied across the globe due to differences in rhythm manifestations and management of the disease but also due to differences in non-COVID-19 medical care and resources available to physicians. The incidence, diagnosis, and management of arrhythmias and conduction system disease have varied across populations, cities, countries, and continents worldwide. We will also describe how COVID-19 affected routine electrophysiology practice and procedural volume.",

            "text": "Our finding that patients with COVID-19 infection and cardiac arrhythmia had a high burden of cardiovascular comorbidities is consistent with prior reports documenting high rates of these conditions, in particular among critically ill patients. 5, 12, 13 A global survey of electrophysiology professionals conducted by the Heart Rhythm Society in March and April similarly found that atrial arrhythmias were the most common cardiac arrhythmia noted in patients with COVID-19. 7 We noted significant regional differences in the incidence of these comorbidities, and, in particular, metabolic syndrome. Patients in Asia had a lower burden of these diseases, and also had a unique distribution of arrhythmia, with a lower incidence of tachyarrhythmias compared with other regions, and a more significant burden of bradyarrhythmia. This is consistent with prior analyses which have noted a lower prevalence of AF in the Asia Pacific region. 14 The reason for this regional difference is unclear, though plausibly could be related to a decreased prevalence of metabolic syndrome and obesity observed in this cohort. Both inflammation and oxidative stress have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AF and metabolic syndrome, and patients with metabolic syndrome have been shown to have a higher risk of AF. 12, 13, 15 Additionally, a proinflammatory state has been repeatedly implicated in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 infection, with several treatments proposed to mitigate the inflammatory cascade, including hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids, and IL-6 receptor inhibition. [16] [17] [18] COVID-19 treatment protocols varied significantly across the globe, likely due to differences in mechanisms of care, burden of illness in the community, and timing of the peak infection rate. For example, hydroxychloroquine was not standard therapy for COVID-19 in the early months of infection. However, several retrospective studies suggesting a beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine were published in March and April, concurrent to the peak infection in much of Europe and the northeast United States. [19] [20] [21] The majority of patients in these regions were treated with hydroxychloroquine in our series. However, as ongoing investigations have not confirmed benefit of this treatment regimen, patients in South America may have been less likely to receive this medication given the later onset of peak infection in this region of the world. While antivirals such as oseltamivir and remdesivir were used in almost all patients in Asia and the majority of patients in Europe, patients in North and South America were infrequently treated with these medications. Although dexamethasone has recently shown some promise in treating patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection, data regarding frequency of steroid use in this cohort was unavailable and cannot be commented on. 17 The majority of patients with COVID-19 infection and cardiac arrhythmia were treated with systemic anticoagulation. The primary indication for anticoagulation is not known; many patients may have been anticoagulated to prevent thromboembolic events related to atrial arrhythmias. Others may have had a prior history of thromboembolism or developed acute complications in the setting of critical illness, especially given concern for a diseaserelated hypercoagulable state. 22, 23 Indeed, during the pandemic there was interest in the utilization of therapeutic dose anticoagulation in patients critically ill with COVID-19 infection, which may account for some of the use of therapeutic anticoagulation in this population. 24, 25 At the start of the pandemic, there was substantial concern regarding the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and, in particular, torsade de pointes, given the frequent use of both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, both of which are known to prolong the QTc. Indeed, 40% of patients who developed polymorphic VT were treated with hydroxychloroquine and many had severe prolongation of their QTc, with a max QTc of 514.8\u00b170.5 ms (Bazett correction). Of note, patients who developed monomorphic VT also tended to have prolonged QTc about 25% of patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine, and in both cohorts, patients commonly had reduced LV function at baseline. Taken together, this data suggest that although treatment of hydroxychloroquine may have contributed to the incidence of polymorphic VT in patients with severe COVID-19 infection, the majority of these patients were likely at high risk for this arrhythmia due to preexisting cardiac disease and critical illness. Patients with ventricular arrhythmias tended to be critically ill with a high prevalence of mechanical ventilation, renal failure, hypoxia, and severe hypotension at the time that the arrhythmia occurred.",

The majority of patients in our cohort with arrhythmias had comorbid conditions, including congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease, and likely were predisposed to the development of cardiac arrhythmias. The possibility of direct and indirect myocardial injury in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection has also been extensively discussed and may play a role in the cause of cardiac arrhythmia in this population. 12, 23 Myocardial injury, as assessed by cardiac biomarkers, has been reported in up to 25% of patients with severe COVID-19 infection, and both acute myocardial injury and dysfunction associated with cardiogenic shock and myocardial injury that develops as illness severity intensifies have been described. Stress-induced myopathy, hypoxia-mediated cardiac apoptosis, proarrhythmic inflammatory state and cytokine storm, and myocardial injury due to viral invasion via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 have all been implicated in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 associated myocardial injury. [26] [27] [28] [29] However, our ability to infer the importance of SARS-CoV-2 related myocardial injury on the development of cardiac arrhythmia is limited by incomplete assessment of histopathologic analysis of viral-induced injury on the cardiac conduction system as well as limited understanding of how focused or diffuse inflammation due to COVID-19 infection may affect the conduction system. Whether or not the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias is higher in patients with COVID-19 infection as compared with patients with other viral illnesses or other critically ill populations remains unclear.",

Several collaborators have published detailed reports of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on procedural volume. In the Lombardy and Veneto regions of Italy, rates of urgent pacemaker implantation decreased by 30% during the lockdown. 30 Ancona, Italy, reported a decrease in electrophysiology procedural volume to a median 12 procedures per week compared with a median of 24 per week in the preceding 6 month period, primarily attributed to the postponement of nonurgent interventions. 31 Consistent with our findings, a survey of 84 centers by the Italian association of Arrhythmology and Cardiac Pacing found that >90% of the centers saw a significant decrease in elective device implantation, 77% saw a significant decrease in elective ablations, 70% saw a significant decrease in emergent device implantations, and 55% saw a significant decrease in emergent ablations compared with the same period in 2019. 32 This is the largest worldwide survey of cardiac arrhythmia occurring in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection.

Additionally, some regional differences in treatment may be due to changes in our understanding of the disease process and treatment outcomes over time. This cohort was limited to cases that were submitted by each institution and often were not fully representative of all cases in that particular hospital, city, state, country, or continent. The majority of cases of arrhythmia (60%) were submitted by institutions in North America, and 40% were submitted by institutions in New York City which primarily saw patients early in the pandemic. This may skew the results and limit the generalizability of the results. Because data were collected by cardiac electrophysiologists, data in the full cohort is likely skewed towards patients with cardiac arrhythmia. Additionally, resources during the pandemic were scarce, and not all patients received 12-lead electrocardiograms or routine cardiac rhythm monitoring as part of their care, which limited the ability to identify the true burden of arrhythmia in this population. Similarly, other evaluations such as echocardiography or computed tomography were performed sparingly in this population, even in patients who were critically ill, limiting the ability to make inferences regarding the causes of the arrhythmia. Due to these limitations, we did not conduct comparative statistical analysis to avoid making comparisons among heterogeneous groups.",

Many patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection developed cardiac arrhythmia, which was associated with high morbidity and mortality and highlights the need for electrophysiologists to be involved in COVID-19 care. Regional differences in the type of arrhythmias affecting these patients may provide important insights into the pathophysiology of both SARS-CoV-2 infection and of the arrhythmia itself. Future investigations regarding the mechanisms of the cardiac complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection may aid in our understanding of arrhythmia in this population.",
