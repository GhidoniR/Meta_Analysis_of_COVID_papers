This standard requires less evidence, but the U.S. FDA will still perform a risk-benefit analysis to determine whether authorizing the device is worthwhile. The FDA will also determine whether there is an alternative option available that has already been cleared/approved, and if there must still be a gap in the market before it can be justified. The FDA analyzes requests on a \"case-by-case basis,\" but is \"prepared to issue EUAs expeditiously (e.g., within hours or days).\" Once the public health emergency is over, those authorizations end and companies either have to pull the devices from the market, destroy them, or put them back to their originally authorized use. This was eye-opening to me as I look at the shortages of critical medical equipment across the world. For example, a hospital in Malawi has only two ventilators for an entire hospital; therefore, life-saving surgeries are delayed or canceled simply due to a lack of ventilators. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients die due to a lack of monitoring. When basic yet effective ventilators and/or monitors are developed and manufactured, and many lives could be saved, it seems so wasteful to destroy them. However, by allowing them to stay in use could prove detrimental as well (Shuren and Maisel, 2021) .",

Once the measurement is completed, the processor extracts some key features of the pulsatile signals, such as pulse rate, and feeds them into a probabilistic machine learning model that has been trained to make predictions on whether the individual is showing certain signals, such as hypercoagulation in blood. Hypercoagulation is known to be a common abnormality in COVID-19 patients. The result is provided in the form of different colored lights used to indicate if an individual is demonstrating certain biomarkers, or if the result is inconclusive.",

Unfortunately, communications necessary for telemedicine missions to remote, disaster-relief, or combat environments cannot depend on commercial networks. The idea of the establishment of Instant Telecommunication Infrastructure (ITI) using drones was presented and showcased a drone platform that concentrated on providing communications for performing pre-and post-operative evaluations of patients and tele-mentoring of certain surgical procedures in remote areas. Tele-mentoring is the provision of remote guidance by an experienced surgeon or proceduralist to a less experienced colleague, with emerging procedures using computers and telecommunications (Rosser et al., 1997) . Using this ITI concept, Harnett et al.

The authors, Dr. Breidge Boyle, Dr. Chloe Shaw, Dr. Katie Gallagher, Dr. Julia Petty, and Alexandra Mancini, all from the United Kingdom conducted a thematic analysis on written reflections by neonatal nurses worldwide, exploring their experiences of COVID-19, during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Common challenges faced by neonatal nurses, as well as common ways in which these challenges were overcome are identified. Twenty-two reflections were analysed from eleven countries. The reflections underscore the importance of family integrated care and the tension created when it is compromised.

It has changed how pregnant women and their partners receive support during pregnancy, labour, birth and in the postnatal period. During the COVID-19 pandemic, parents with sick or premature babies have faced challenges following admission to a neonatal unit due to the imposed lock-down restrictions on social contact, hospital visitation and the wearing of personal protective equipment (Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), 2020). While the longer-term impact of such lock-down restrictions on neonatal care are yet to be fully known, there are negative immediate and short-term effects, in relation to the prevention of proximity, contact and bonding between parents and their babies (Green et al., 2020a; Stuebe, 2020) . The negative short-term impact on neonatal care in relation to the prevention of proximity, contact and bonding between parents and babies is potentially significant; however, an interesting finding has been reported of a reduction in premature birth admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit during the pandemic, raising important questions. Why was this? Was it related to the effect of the modifiable risk-factors for premature birth?",

The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has altered the daily routines of parents and families with a baby in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit across the globe. As discussed earlier, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged healthcare facilities in promoting a patient-and family-centered (PFCC) care environment by imposing limitations on personal and physical interactions. Parental trauma, stress, depression, and fatigue have been reported in parents who have an infant admitted to a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), and may be further heightened when interactions and participation in caring for their infant is further limited, or even prohibited due to COVID-19 imposed restrictions (Busse et al., 2013; Lasiuk et al., 2013) . Routine care, the consistent presence of families in the NICU, family supports, bedside education, and frequent face-to-face staff-family communications have been successfully implemented in NICUs around the world, which promote PFCC and encourage bonding (Davidson et al., 2017; Treherne et al., 2017) . However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these strategies must now be modified. The authors, Clare Kranz, Jo Duff, Kara Curnen, and Ann Reed, from The Primary Children's Hospital (and Auburn University, School of Nursing) in Utah, USA, share their manuscript titled, \"Engaging Parents of Hospitalized Neonates During A Pandemic.\" The purpose of this manuscript is to describe unique and innovative strategies to promote core concepts of PFCC in order to ensure parent engagement and parent-infant bonding, while simultaneously controlling exposure to the novel coronavirus.",

In utero, the infant is contained in a circumferential enclosed space with 360 degrees of well-defined boundaries. The inherent goal of positioning is to support the premature infant's body as closely as possible to the position the baby would have been in the womb. Supporting body containment of the infant in the NICU environment increases the infant's feelings of security, decreases stress, and reduces excessive energy expenditure. Forming a \"nest\" with soft boundaries, as well as a padded foot-roll for foot-bracing, provides postural, behavioral, and physiological stability to the newborn. Infants who are contained within soft boundaries are calmer, require less medication, sleep longer and gain weight more rapidly. Ensuring secure containment with firm and flexible positioning aids promotes a reflex stimulus for extremity extension and subsequent flexion recoil, furthering the ability of the baby to remain in a midline, flexed and contained position. Therapeutic supportive positioning devices must allow spontaneous movement, provide tactile and proprioceptive containment, and displace infant body weight when placed in alternative positions, such as prone or side-lying (Altimier and White, 2020) .",

For parents of a NICU baby, learning to care and interact with their infant presents unexpected complications, including learning to cope and be close to their baby in an unfamiliar setting (Cardin, 2020) . This is further complicated by the need for healthcare staff to use face-masks and personal protective equipment when caring for infants in the NICU, which has inevitably altered traditional developmental care approaches undertaken in the UK (Altimier et al., 2015) . The current COVID -19 pandemic has challenged all aspects of neonatal work, causing anxiety and stress for all involved in infant care. Neonatal teams have been working together to provide excellent care, while adapting to the difficult and unfamiliar situations raised from the COVID-19 global pandemic. A major change to practice has been the need to limit parent access to baby in the NICU. The English Speech and Language Therapists, Harding, Aloysius, Bell, Edney, Gordon, Lewis, Sweeting, and Murphy, present areas of particular concern, which are the effect of necessary adaptations in neonatal management on preparing infants for and establishing early feeding skills, as well as supporting and enabling parent-infant early bonding, communication, and interaction.",
