The primary purpose of this article is to propose a novel risk-based, decision-making methodology capable of unveiling causal relationships between pairs of variables. Motivated by the ongoing global emergency of the coronavirus pandemic, the article elaborates on this powerful quantitative framework drawing on data from the United States at the county level aiming at assisting policy and decision makers in taking timely action amid this emergency. This methodology offers a basis for identifying potential scenarios and consequences of the ongoing 2020 pandemic by drawing on weather variables to examine the causal impact of changing weather on the trend of daily coronavirus cases.",

Despite the large number of risk-based decision-making frameworks developed in that respect, it is nevertheless interesting to note that they tend to only rarely incorporate causal arguments in the treatment of decisions, even though real-world practice decisions often depend heavily on causal knowledge and reasoning (Hagmayer & Fernbach, 2017) . Although the scope of decisions generally involves determining potential actions (e.g., identifying the location that must go into lockdown due to steadily increasing numbers of the 2019 Coronavirus, cases) or outcomes requiring actions (e.g., a healthcare system under strain) (Borasio, Gamondi, Obrist, & Jox, 2020; Hanna, Evans, & Booth, 2020) , it can be expanded to include risk-based criteria. For example, under the assumption of instituting and enforcing a lockdown in an area, decision and policymakers must examine a set of other actions (as they, jointly, help mitigate the COVID-19 spread); thus, allowing health systems to better cope with this disease and expedite the resumption of economic activity. The outcomes of such decisions largely depend on underlying causal mechanisms. Lockdowns, for instance, allow healthcare systems to better cope with this disease (as well as facilitating the smooth resumption of economic activities afterward); however, the outcomes depend on a complex system of factor interactions. Lockdowns may keep people at a physical distance, resulting in flattening an area's coronavirus curve of the number of new cases of hospitalizations or deaths; while also giving rise to increased mental health issues (thus, potentially, putting more strain onto the welfare system) (Kumar & Nayar, 2020) . Thus, causal knowledge about the system under consideration assists society in making adaptive decisions, therefore, enhancing risk management.",

In this regard, the proposed methodology extends the risk triplet (Kaplan, 1997; Kaplan & Garrick, 1981) of scenarios, likelihoods, and consequences to accommodate an explicit treatment of causality that might be implicitly included in the decision making. Such an approach enables accounting for the performance of a complex system including likely outcomes, sensitivities, areas of importance, system interactions, and areas of uncertainty. The resulting risk quadruplet not only considers the set of the first three standard questions to define \"risk\" based on the standard risk triplet (What can go wrong? How likely is it? and What are the consequences?), but also addresses explicitly the fourth question (What are the causal relations?). The latter is key to risk assessment research, since deciphering the nature of causal interactions of different variables relevant to a complex system can aid us in assessing its evolution, and thus improve our decision-and policy-making abilities.",

According to their treatment, each time series can be represented through patterns that account for one-step-ahead percentage changes. Symbolic dynamics allow the patterns to expose the nature of causality, yet not before a valid causal relationship is first identified. Time series belonging to the same dynamical system are parts of a common attractor, which corresponds to the states of that system. In the present article, the PC framework's steps are abstracted in a way that can be used for a wide spectrum of decision-making settings (hereafter, referred to abstractly as \"systems\"), such as in business, economy, weather, ecosystems, climate, pandemics, and more. This approach breaks down decision making into a series of basic steps. It can add value to almost any situation, especially where serious or catastrophic outcomes are of concern. These steps can be used at different levels of detail and with varying degrees of formality, depending on the situation. The key to using the process is in completing each step in the most simple, practical way to provide the information a decisionmaker or policymaker needs. Some situations are so complex that detailed causal assessments are needed, but most can be addressed with simpler causal assessments.",

The data typically resonate with our 1 We specifically focus on a new measure of causality instead of the standard correlation measure as the causal relationships hold explanatory power (Stavroglou, Pantelous, Stanley, & Zuev, 2019 , 2020 .On the one hand, correlation looks for statistical linear coupling between two variables, and \u03c1(X, Y ) = \u03c1(Y, X ). Thus, correlation ignores whether X drives Y or the other way around. On the other hand, causality primes in the identification of whether X drives Y or Y drives X. This is very crucial for understanding the system's dynamics, for better formulating prediction tasks, and for better hedging against risk. The interested reader may consider (Stavroglou et al., 2019 (Stavroglou et al., , 2020 . understanding of causal relations among variables and contain implications for subsequent decisions. However, whether data becomes information or not, depends on what the decisionmaker expects to extract from them. In this regard, before proceeding further with the directed analysis, as a second step, filtering out some of the key variables is necessary. In this framework, exploring dependencies throughout a time horizon 2 retains only time series variables. Consequently, all other categories of data are removed. After completing the initial filtering, only time series variables, X 1 , X 2 , . . . , X N , Y \u2208 R, depicted as nodes in Fig. 1 4 are retained. These variables have some implied-yet currently unknowncausal structure. 5 In real-world applications, variables identified for a particular decision situation from different perspectives (X 1 , X 2 , . . . , X N , Y ) are not only subject to a causal network structure (see Fig. 1 (a)) but also are governed by the same attractor dynamics, that is, belong to the same manifold M \u2208 R E (see the orange manifold in Fig. 1(b) ). 6 These dynamics can approximately be observed by rendering scatterplots of combinations of two or three variables. For illustration purposes, Fig. 1(b) shows the Lorenz attractor which is built by taking the scatterplot of the three constituent variables that comprise the Lorenz differential equations (Lorenz, 2004) . In practice, it is often the case that such scatterplots, particularly when produced from real-world data, visually appear as nothing but noise, which does not help in a decisionmaking process. Therefore, since it is essential not to rely on visual techniques, our treatment algorithmically exploits the underlying attractor dynamics to perform causality-based predictions, which can be used in decision making.",

The optimal combination of E and \u03c4 is the one which produces the highest causality accuracy from X i to Y . However, in real-world applications, it is possible for decisionmakers to have to choose among different combinations of E and \u03c4 with very comparable levels of causality accuracy. In this regard, the time scales of the variables (which might be in minutes, hours, days, years, etc.) as well as the decisionmaker's knowledge or understanding of the overall system (i.e., some systems involve cyclical behavior, others are more stochastic) play a pivotal role on which of the optimal combinations of E and \u03c4 to pick. In particular, for short time series the 7 Limited for plotting to up to three dimensions. 8 Note that the shadow attractor reconstructed using time lags of X 1 (t ) and Y (t ) is denoted by M X 1 (t ), and M Y (t ) \u2208 R E , accordingly, in order to simplify the notation of the shadow attractor (time t is eliminated), except where indicated. decisionmaker needs to consider the first causality point (FCP) that reflects the minimum number of points in the shadow attractor. 9 Once a decisionmaker identifies the optimal combination of E and \u03c4 for each pair X i \u2192 Y , then the following two questions should be answered: \"Shall the optimal combination of E and \u03c4 for each pair separately be used (namely, choice A)?\" or \"shall the optimal combination over all pairs be used (namely, choice B)?\" The latter is calculated by getting the average accuracy over all pairs for each combination of E and \u03c4 . On the one hand, choice A may be better when dealing with few variables, that is, for small data sets, where getting into an analytical narrative of the various combinations of E and \u03c4 should not be a hurdle. However, another case for choice A would be when the accuracy variances over all pairs under the same E and \u03c4 combinations are intolerably high, which would suggest the loss of valuable causal information and predictive capacity for some neighborhood projection and the rationale behind it is that if X i \u2192 Y (causes), then topological information on M X should accurately predict topological information on M Y . At this stage, two important intermediate considerations require the attention of a decisionmaker. First, in order to identify the nearest neighbors, distances of points on the attractor need to be calculated. This can be achieved in many ways by implementing different metric distances. In general, someone may consider the Minkowski distance for some exponent p (for p = 2, the Euclidean distance yields). The higher the p, the more the distant points are penalized. If the decisionmaker decides to treat all the points equally, then p should equal 1, effectively yielding the Manhattan distance. 12 Second, the number of nearest neighbors to keep for the next step (see Fig. 2 (b)) should be set, which might vary due to the nature of the system studied. Theoretically, E + 1 nearest neighbors are sufficiently enough because they create a simplex of higher dimension around the current point's neighborhood, and thus contain all the topological information needed (Kantz & Schreiber, 2003) . However, the decisionmaker may decide to include more nearest neighbors to transfer a more representative assembly of topological information into the next step.",

Patterns' possible forms and complexity increase as the embedding dimension E increases. Using the weights of the projected nearest neighbors and their corresponding patterns, their signature (see Fig. 3 (a)) is calculated which is merely their weighted average pattern. If the signature coincides with the actual pattern of M Y , then it is marked in this time step as X i caused Y . This is called in-sample prediction and is used to assess causality.

Keeping for each pair their highest causality type only (positive, dark, or negative) allows for a bird's eye view of the three possible aspects of our causal network (see Fig. 4 ). Therefore, it makes sense to just focus on the single or few critical variables, and the way they are influenced by the rest of the variables. Fig. 4 provides a bird's eye view of the three possible aspects of the causal network, and the previous section serves as a reconnaissance step, but our purpose is to exploit the causal relationships identified to perform risk analysis. In this regard, one very important perspective is the identification of causal chains (for each causal relationship). A causal chain is a successive accurate causality of the same type. The weights used are inversely proportional to the distance of the nearest neighbors. (b) From the predicted signature, the corresponding pattern is derived (as shown horizontally) and by seeing how it combines with the causal variable's pattern we can derive what type of causality holds (provided that the predicted signature's pattern is accurately predicted). (c) Repeating this process for each time step leads to the generation of the aggregate causality matrix which summarizes the combinations of patterns met. Therefore, three types of causal chains are possible: positive, dark, and negative ( Fig. 5(a) left) in correspondence with the three types of causality identified in the previous step. The repetitive observation of a relatively long chain type (\"long\" depends on the problem context) can be used to probabilistically expect the future movements of the critical variable(s).",

However, the factors may have different levels of importance in the final decision. Therefore, an orderly decision analysis structure that considers more than just risk is necessary to give decisionmakers the information needed to make smart choices. In that context our framework, and especially the causal chains it reveals, can enhance the risk triplet framework (scenarios, critical variable frequency distribution, consequences (Borgonovo et al., 2018; Kaplan & Garrick, 1981; Kumar & Nayar, 2020) , thus generating risk quadruplets (i.e., risk triplet plus causal factors). Fig 5. (a) Considering the type of causality at each time step we can collect the causal chains that influence the critical variable(s). The critical variable Y , partly influenced by the causal variables (X 1 , X 2 , . . . , X N ), takes roughly three ranges of values corresponding to tolerable, risky and catastrophic scenarios associated with the critical variable. (b) The totality of causality on the critical variable can be summarized via their respective frequency distributions in terms of their successive incidents (causal chains). Analytically, for a given system we collect: (1) The possible scenarios (S j ) for our problem settings, (2) the frequency distribution of the critical variable(s) (F j ) that determine which scenario occurs in the first place, (3) the consequences y j that emerge from each scenario, both beneficial and detrimental, and (4) the causal relationships A j that affect the critical variable(s) which can be summarized by their chains frequency distributions (as discussed in the previous section, see also Fig. 5(b) ). Collectively those four components comprise the risk quadruplet, R (see Fig. 6(a) ), which is a risk analytic mani-festation of our causal risk-based decision-making framework.",

In particular, examples of COVID-19 specific influencing factors include the numbers of COVID-19 cases, deaths, ages, severe travel restrictions, product suspensions, supply chain interruptions, among many others. Both epidemiological and laboratory studies have reported that weather might be an important factor in the transmission and survival of disease agents (Casanova, Jeon, Rutala, Weber, & Sobsey, 2010; Gupta, Raghuwanshi, & Chanda, 2020; Martens & McMichael, 2002) . 13 Recently, the stability of COVID-19 has been reported to be similar to that of SARS CoV-1 on various types of inanimate surfaces in specific weather conditions (van Doremalen et al., 2020) . Thus, in our case study, data only on temperature and precipitation are considered as approximate proxies for weather conditions, in order to investigate their causal interaction with the critical variable (Y ) which measures the daily number of COVID-19 cases for scenarios' formulation. 14 Historical data for the United States on the state and county level is collected from 23rd January till 31st May, 2020. 15 The state and county files contain FIPS 16 codes, which is a standard geographic identifier to facilitate our analysis as it permits the combination of this data with temperature and precipitation data retrieved from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the United States. 17 The treatment proposed herein can be easily extended to include other factors once data on them become available.",

Looking at the frequency distribution of COVID-19 cases in California, reveals a significant concentration between 1,000 and 2,500 cases per day, a fact which renders the situation risky. Being in scenario 3, one would expect, according to Table I , a high impact on physical distancing, medium impact on travel restrictions, face masks usage, lockdown, government support, supply chain interruption, reduced consumption, and working capital pressure. Of course, all this refers to the situation as of 31 May. However, in order to be able to better plan for the imminent future, the decisionmaker needs the fourth component of the risk quadruplet which is the causal impact on the critical variable of the daily COVID-19 cases.

Looking at the frequency distribution of COVID-19 cases in Illinois, reveals a significant concentration up to 3,000 cases per day a fact which renders the situation risky. Being in scenario 2, this suggests, according to Table I, a medium impact on physical distancing, face masks usage, government support, and low impact on travel restrictions, lockdown, supply chain interruption, reduced consumption, and working capital pressure. Of course, all this refers to the situation as of 31 May. However, to be able to better plan for the imminent future, the decisionmaker needs the fourth component of the risk quadruplet which is the causal impact on the critical variable of daily COVID-19 cases.

The case of New York: According Fig. 7 , daily COVID cases had been increasing until April, dropping dramatically during May. Setting a 1 = 1, 000 daily COVID-19 cases, as a result, New York is, as of May 31, under Scenario 1 (\"tolerable\"). Looking at the frequency distribution of COVID-19 cases in New York reveals a significant concentration between up to 1,000 cases per day, a fact which renders the situation very manageable. Being in scenario 1, this suggests, according to Table I , a medium impact on physical distancing and low impact on travel restrictions, face masks usage, lockdown, government support, supply chain interruption, reduced consumption, and working capital pressure. Of course, all this refers to the situation as of 31 May. However, in order to be able to better plan for the imminent future, the decisionmaker needs the fourth component of the Risk Quadruplet which is the causal impact on the critical variable of daily COVID-19 cases.

The treatment proposed herein can be easily extended to including other factors once data on them become available.",
