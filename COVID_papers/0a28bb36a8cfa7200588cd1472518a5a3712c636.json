            "text": "Coastal sands are important natural recreational facilities that have become hotspots for tourism and economic development. However, these sands harbour diverse microbial assemblages that play a critical role in the balance between public health and ecology. In this study, targeted high-throughput sequencing analysis was used to identify sand-borne bacterial populations at four public beaches in Durban. The effect of heavy metal in shaping the distribution of bacterial metacommunities was determined using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), while the functional gene profiles were predicted using PICRUSt2 analysis. Sequences matching those of the bacterial phylum Proteobacteria were the most abundant in all samples, followed by those of the phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Gemmatimonadetes. Genus-level taxonomic analysis showed the presence of 1163 bacterial genera in all samples combined. The distribution of bacterial communities was shaped by heavy metal concentrations, with the distribution of Flavobacteria, Bacteroidia, and Deltaproteobacteria influenced by Pb and Zn, while B and Cr influenced the distribution of Clostridia and Gammaproteobacteria, respectively. Identified antibiotic resistance genes included the peptidoglycan biosynthesis gene II, III, IV, and V, as well as the polymyxin resistance gene, while the virulence genes included the sitA, fimB, aerobactin synthase, and pilL gene. Our findings demonstrate that beach sand-borne bacteria are reservoirs of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. Contamination of beach sands with heavy metals selects for both heavy metal resistance and antibiotic resistance in beach sand bacterial communities. Children and immunocompromised people engaging in recreational activities on beaches may be exposed to higher risk of infection.",

Worldwide, coastlines with long stretches of clean, and sandy beaches have become major economic zones, with tourist expenditures on accommodation, food and drink, entertainment, and other services and goods topping US$1260 billion each year (UNWTO 2016) . Pre-COVID-19 predictions had placed global coastal tourism associated expenditures at above US$5 billion a day by the year 2020 (Orams 2003) , underpinning the importance of sandy beaches to world economies. More people use sandy beaches than any other type of seashore as they provide the most productive fishing grounds, and offer perfect opportunities for sand bathing, a practice most common among the young and old beachgoers alike. However, sandy beaches are not just piles of sand; they harbour their own micro-ecosystems. They receive large inputs of organic matter supplied by the seawater, consisting of phytobenthos assimilates, and products washed and leached out from seaweeds, animal faeces, and remains of plants and animals (Mudryk et al. 2013 ). This creates optimal conditions for the growth of a high population of organisms such as small invertebrates, bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi, yeast, virus, algae, and diatoms (Zakaria et al. 2011; Whitman et al. 2014; Di Piazza et al. 2017) , making beach sand a potential reservoir for aetiological agents of disease (Solo-Gabriele et al. 2015) . Since sandy beaches are dynamic and sensitive Communicated by Erko Stackebrandt. places where life is under pressure, these sandy beach dwelling microorganisms exhibit remarkable physiological and behavioural adaptation to changing environmental conditions (Defeo et al. 2009 ). Microbiological assemblages in sandy shorelines play crucial roles in the decomposition of organic matter and pollutants, and nutrient mineralization and recycling, ecosystem services which render sandy beaches safe for beachgoers (Amaral et al. 2016) . At the same time, coastal sediments are the ultimate sink of heavy metals discharged into aquatic environments, and their analysis is thought to offer a more convenient and more accurate means of determining the degree of pollution (Al-edresy et al. 2019) . This is because heavy metal toxicity has a double effect on environmental microbial assemblages. First, heavy metal toxicity selects for heavy metal tolerance/resistance (Dickinson et al. 2019) . Second, it selects for antibiotic resistance in microbial pathogens (Sabry et al. 1997 ) by two main mechanisms, namely co-resistance and cross-resistance (Nguyen et al. 2019) . The microbial risk posed to sand bathers is therefore heightened if such microbes harbour antibiotic resistance genes.",

            "text": "The establishment of major urban centers in close proximity to the majority of sandy beaches has translated into increased anthropogenic pressure upon these natural resources, either as a result of discharge of sewage effluents and storm runoff, or as a direct consequence of recreation associated pollutions such as bather faecal shedding (Orams 2003) . Also, due to tidal wave action, the microbiological quality of beach sand is positively correlated to the microbiological quality of the beach water (Weiskerger et al. 2019) . Where a beach is located close to a sewage treatment plant outfall, contact with beach sand increases the risk of gastrointestinal illness by a factor almost similar to that of coming into direct contact with sewage polluted water (Devine 2014) . Beachgoers are impacted by contaminated beach sands either indirectly by degrading beach water quality through cycles of deposition and resuspension of pathogens between sand and water, or more directly through physical contact with/or ingestion of sands (Halliday et al. 2014) . Sensitive populations such as children, the elderly, or those with a weakened immune system are particularly at risk for long-term effects. From a public health perspective, knowledge of the microbial assemblages inhabiting recreational sand beaches could lead to the evaluation of the levels and trends of contaminants, as well as following human contact with sand; to an assessment of the effects on public health. Currently, beach advisories and closures are issued depending on faecal indicator bacterial densities in the beach water column (Zhang et al. 2015) , with relatively less attention paid to their densities in beach sands. However, at times bacterial counts in beach waters can fall to levels considered safe for swimming while higher densities remain in adjacent beach sands, exposing sand bathers to heightened risk compared to swimmers (Whitman and Nevers 2003) . Therefore, this study was aimed at assessing the bacterial communities in the sands of four popular recreational beaches which form the interface between the shoreline of the city of Durban and the Indian Ocean. A 16S rDNA-targeted high-throughput sequencing approach was used to determine the bacterial community structure and composition across the four beaches. Furthermore, the study determined the possible correlations between heavy metal concentrations at the various study sites and the distribution of bacterial metacommunities. Finally, the study predicted the possible functional gene profiles of the bacterial metacommunities using the Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt2) analysis. Though such microbial communities are highly dynamic in nature, such that a study carried a year ago may not necessarily be used to predict the microbial quality of recreational beach sand today, no study has ever been carried out to determine the bacterial and fungal communities of Durban's sand beaches. This is a significant knowledge gap given the popularity of Durban's beaches; a city that attracts the 6 th most number of tourists into the African continent due to its year-round friendly climate and long expanses of sandy beaches. To the best of our knowledge, this study stands to be the first ever to characterise the bacterial communities inhabiting the sandy beaches of Durban using high-throughput sequencing analysis.",

The city of Durban boasts a wealth of coastal resources along its 97 km of coastline with the Indian Ocean. These include rocky shores, mangrove forests, coral reefs, coastal forests, wetlands, and sandy beaches. Of these, the least studied and most underappreciated are sandy beaches. Durban beaches are tourism hotspots owing to good weather that the City experiences all year-round, with average winter temperatures ranging from 11 \u00b0C to 24 \u00b0C, while summer temperatures average between 20 \u00b0C and 29 \u00b0C. Durban's beaches are characterised by vast expanses of white sands, and gentle slopping coastlines, making them convenient for sand bathing, surfing, and swimming. Tourism is very important to the local economy. Samples were collected from the South Beach, Harbour Beach, Central Beach, and North Beach (Fig. 1) . The later three beaches are in the range of approximately 3 km from each other, while South Beach is furthest from the rest, approximately 15 km. Approximately 100 g of sand sample were collected at each beach from five points about 5 m apart. A core sampler was used to collect sand samples in a vertical fashion from the surface down to about 10 cm deep at the foreshore zone. Sand samples from each beach were put in specimen bottles, labelled according to the collection sites, and transported to the laboratory at the University of South Africa in cooler boxes containing ice at 4 \u00baC for further processing.",

Identified antibiotic resistance genes included the peptidoglycan biosynthesis II (staphylococci) exhibited in the Harbour, North, and South samples (Fig. 5) . Others included the peptidoglycan biosynthesis III (mycobacteria), IV (Enterococcus faecium), and V (beta-lactam resistance), as well as the polymyxin resistance gene, which was identified in all samples. The identified virulence genes included the sitA gene, the fimB gene, the aerobactin synthase gene, and pilL gene, all of which were detected in bacterial metacommunities from all sampling sites. Table 2 show that there were slight differences between the ACE and Chao1 species richness estimators. Hughes et al. (2001) point out that the ACE and Chao1 estimators are similar in that they are nonparametric. They are different in that the Chao1 estimator gives greater weight to low abundance species (species with less than 10 individuals in a sample), while the ACE estimator gives greater weight to species sample coverage (species with more than 10 individuals in a sample) (Kim et al. 2017) . In this study, however, both estimators still showed high bacterial species richness in all beach sand samples, as also observed in other beach sand samples (Mudryk et al. 2013; Rom\u00e3o et al. 2017 ). This confirms earlier findings that beach sands are microhabitats teaming with microbial life (Sabino et al. 2014; Whitman et al. 2014; Solo-Gabriele et al. 2015) . The disparities observed between the Shannon-Weaver diversity and the Simpson's diversity indices imply that, while beach sand samples had high species richness, they had low species evenness. This trend has also been observed in other studies of a similar nature, including that of Gobet et al. (2012) . While most microbes found in beach sand are harmless, some are linked with human disease (Rettner 2018 ). Therefore, understanding the microbial community structure and biodiversity of beach sand is useful for assessing the ecological health of the beach sand, as higher biodiversity usually confers better resistance and resilience against environmental perturbation and contamination (Cui et al. 2013) . The dominance of bacteria belonging to the phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes in beach sands has earlier been documented in coastal beach samples (Zheng et al. 2014; Rom\u00e3o et al. 2017) . This may indicate that these phyla have evolved to be the main indigenous bacterial communities in coastal intertidal zones. Bacteria belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria are known for their metabolic plasticity (Esposti 2014) , causing them to be able to colonise the most diverse environments compared to other bacterial phyla. This could be the reason why, at genus level, greater than 50% of recovered OTUs belonged to the phylum Proteobacteria. As well as being metabolically diverse, this phylum is known for containing the most number of bacterial pathogens in its ranks (Rizzatti et al. 2017) .",

            "text": "However, many other bacterial phyla identified in our study house essentially non-pathogenic bacteria. Most such bacteria have fundamental roles in the biogeochemical cycles of nutrients/mineral in the sediments (Zheng et al. (Zheng et al. 2014) , while bacteria of the genus Ochrobactrum are known for hydrocarbon degradation (Octaviany et al. 2019) . Sequences representing harmless bacterial populations were the most abundant in this study. These included sequences for Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus helveticus, Bifidobacterium animalis, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Lactobacillus buchneri, which are largely used in the food industry as probiotics (Margolles and S\u00e1nchez 2012; Smokvina et al. 2013; Sugahara et al. 2015; Wong et al. 2019) . Nonetheless, because these probiotic bacteria are natural flora of the gastrointestinal tracts of humans, and that of other animals (Mikkelsen et al. 2003) , the abundance of sequences representing these bacterial species in beach sand samples serves as an important indicator of faecal pollution. Such faecal pollution could emanate either from faecal shedding by sand bathers, direct faecal deposition by animals and birds, or from faecally contaminated sea water washing onto the beach sands (Whitman et al. 2014 ). However, the presence of other Bifidobacterium sp. like Bifidobacterium dentium can be used to determine faecal contamination of exclusively human origin (Nebra et al. 2003; Furet et al. 2009 ), and can be useful in determining the public health safety of recreational beaches. Although such allochthonous microorganisms get subjected to various biotic and abiotic pressures that affect their fate in the new environment (Feng et al. 2010; Gobet et al. 2012) , microorganisms of enteric origin in beach sands may be incidentally ingested, leading to carriage, colonization, or even infection. Sequences belonging to the genera Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Methylobacterium were both detected in the South and North beach sand samples. Achromobacter xylosoxidans is an emerging, multidrug-resistant opportunistic pathogen which invades cystic fibrosis (CF) patients' airways, as well as cause a wide variety of infections in immunocompromised patients (Marion-sanchez et al. 2019) . Its presence in recreational beaches presents a potential health risk to beach goers, more so to immunocompromised persons. Amoureux et al. (2013) earlier reported that this bacterium is innately resistant to cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, aztreonam, and aminoglycosides, and frequently shows acquired resistance to carbapenems, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin, drastically limiting therapeutic choices for infected individuals. However, that largely depends on the environment from which it is isolated, with clinical strains having proven pathogenesis. Apart from this study, there are no previous reports linking A. xylosoxidans to beach sands. Previous reports show that it has been found in some plants, polluted soils, well water, domestic and hospital drains, as well as freshwater bodies frequently used for recreational purposes (Amoureux et al. 2013) . Being an emerging pathogen, the natural habitat for A. xylosoxidans, as well as its medium of spread are not yet known. Therefore, the identification of potential environmental reservoirs of this bacterium might aid in the prevention of infection among CF patients as well as immunocompromised individuals. Transmission of infectious diseases in beach environments can occur via direct exposure to microbes found in the sand through such routes as dermal contact, contact with eyes and ears, inhalation, and ingestion (Solo-Gabriele et al. 2015) . The varied, though inevitable interactions between different beach sand zones and beach water make beach sand a potential source of such pathogens in beach water also (Feng et al. 2010; Cui et al. 2013) , which increases the risk of exposure to not only the sand bathers but the surfers and swimmers too. Methylobacterium sp., meanwhile, is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen in immunocompromised persons. It is reported to form biofilms, and to be tolerant to disinfecting agents, high temperatures, and drying (Kovaleva et al. 2014 ), a befitting reason as to why their sequences were found in relatively high percentage abundances in beach sand samples in this study.",

Bacteria belonging to the genus Aeromicrobium have previously been isolated from sea water by Bruns et al (2003) who described it as an obligately salt-dependent Gram-positive bacterium affiliated to the family Nocardioidaceae, within the order Actinomycetales. While there are currently no reports of its recovery from other environments except sea water, the recovery of sequences representing a species in this genus from beach sand provides further proof of tide-assisted microbial interactions between the beach sand and the sea water. Alternatively, this finding could suggest that this bacterium could be found in more diverse environments, and not just in the seawater. However, both the health significance and the influence of anthropogenic pressure on the distribution of this bacterium is currently unknown. Further studies are needed to, at the least, establish its ecological significance.",

And, just like in other studies (Sandaa et al. 1999; Yao et al. 2016) , canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) in this study revealed differential but positive correlations between heavy metal concentrations and certain bacterial metacommunities. The relationship between antimicrobial resistance and potentially toxic metal resistance in bacteria has been a subject of study for a long time (Chen et al. 2019; Quero et al. 2015) . Findings suggest that environmental heavy metal concentrations both shape the microbial community compositions as well as induce antimicrobial resistance by either cross-or coresistance phenomena (Chen et al. 2015; Nguyen et al. 2019; Yazdankhah et al. 2018) . Environmental reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes such as those observed in this study are of particular public health concern, considering that polymyxin is an antibiotic of last resort in the treatment of Gramnegative bacterial infections (Srinivas and Rivard 2017; Li et al. 2019) . By almost the same measure, \u03b2-lactams are the first and most frequently used class of antibacterial agents used to treat severe infections due to Gram-positive bacteria (Bugg and Walsh 1992; Mainardi et al. 2005) . However, peptidoglycan biosynthesis II in staphylococci and peptidoglycan biosynthesis IV in enterococci usually give rise to \u03b2-lactams resistance due to production of low-affinity penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), like the PBP2a D,Dtranspeptidase protein which results in methicillin resistance in staphylococci, and the PBP5 D,D-transpeptidase protein which results in ampicillin resistance in enterococci (Mainardi et al. 2000 (Mainardi et al. , 2008 . Furthermore, some enterococci strains have been found to acquire antibiotic resistance by completely bypassing the D,D-transpeptidase by an L,D-transpeptidase which confers resistance towards most \u03b2-lactam antibiotics on the organism (Mainardi et al. 2008) .",

            "text": "Type IV Pili, that were possessed by the bacterial metacommunities from all sampling sites, are important virulence factors used by many pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa for attachment to surfaces and host tissues and twitching motility (Kilmury and Burrows 2016) . Transcriptional activation of the fimB gene in uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) leads to increased expression of type 1 pili, a chief virulence factor responsible for UPEC pathogenicity . Urinary tract infections afflict mostly women, with UPEC emerging as the primarily agents of infections in humans (Schwan et al. 2018) . Inside their hosts, pathogenic bacteria are often have to contend with extremely low bioavailability of iron, which thus becomes a limiting factor for survival (Bailey et al. 2018) . Bacterial pathogens circumvent this limitation using unique strategies to scavenge iron, including the synthesis, secretion, and reuptake of iron chelators (siderophores) such as aerobactin, which has since been demonstrated to be critical for virulence in pathogens like Klebsiella pneumoniae (Bailey et al. 2016) and Vibrio mimicus (Moon et al. 2004) . The sitA gene is most prominent among bacterial pathogens which utilize it to mobilize iron and manganese inside eukaryotic cells and is therefore associated with bacterial virulence (Runyen-Janecky et al. 2003; Tivendale et al. 2009 ). Environmental bacteria harbouring reservoirs of both virulence and antibiotic resistance genes, therefore, pose increased risks of human infections, particularly in settings like beaches, since beach visitors tend to spend more time in contact with beach sand than with water (Whitman and Nevers 2003) . Chances of infection are significantly increased if higher pathogen densities are found in the sand than in the water column, as previously observed (Sato et al. 2005) . In particular, children are exposed to greater risk, because they spend more time playing and digging in the sand, where potentially pathogenic bacteria are likely to persist longer due to adsorption to sand particles, unlike free bacteria in the water. In what is a limitation of our study, PCR confirmation of the presence of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes as predicted by PICRUSt2 results could have made our findings very concrete.",

Contamination of beach sands with heavy metals selects for both heavy metal resistance and antibiotic resistance in beach sand microbial communities. The abundance of pathogenic bacterial OTUs in beach sand shows the likelihood of health risks to people engaging in recreational activities in beach sands. In particular, immunocompromised persons are at an increased risk of contracting bacterial infections after beach visits, especially taking into consideration the likelihood of incidental ingestion of beach sand and water. To validate this possibility, future studies may need to quantitatively assess the microbial risk that beach goers are exposed to. However, not all microorganisms in beach sand are pathogenic as others play significant ecological roles including suppression of bacterial pathogens, nutrient recycling, and also as bio-filters.",
