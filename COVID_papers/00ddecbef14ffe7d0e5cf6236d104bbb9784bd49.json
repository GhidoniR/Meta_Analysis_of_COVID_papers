In the following days, small boluses of normal saline were administered in addition to the maintenance fluid, and the serum creatine kinase started to decrease. (B) Liver enzyme levels started to increase the first day and then decreased after small boluses of normal saline were added. The levels follow the same pattern as those for creatine kinase.
