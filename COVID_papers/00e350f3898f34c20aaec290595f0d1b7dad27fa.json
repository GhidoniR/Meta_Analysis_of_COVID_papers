            "text": "Objectives of this study were to determine effects of meloxicam administered in 2 forms on IgG uptake, growth, and health of preweaned calves. Sixteen Holstein bulls and 14 heifers with a body weight (BW) of 44.3 \u00b1 5.24 kg were blocked by birth date in a randomized complete block design. Calves were removed from the dam before suckling, weighed, and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: (1) colostrum replacer (CR) at 0 h with no meloxicam (control; CON), (2) 1 mg/kg of BW of meloxicam in pill form before CR (PL), or (3) 1 mg/kg of BW of meloxicam mixed in solution with CR (SL). Calves were fed 675 g of dry matter of CR, providing a volume of 3 L and 180 g of IgG. Blood samples were collected at 0 h to analyze initial IgG and ketone concentrations, and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 h to analyze IgG uptake. At 24 h, calves were fed 432 g of dry matter of 24% crude protein milk replacer (MR) split in 2 feedings, and free choice starter and water until 42 d. Weekly blood samples were analyzed for glucose, plasma urea nitrogen, and ketone concentrations. Time of consumption of MR, BW, length, hip and withers height, and heart girth were recorded weekly. All calves achieved adequate transfer of immunity. Meloxicam did not affect apparent efficiency of absorption, serum total protein, or IgG uptake at 6, 18, and 24 h; however, meloxicam-treated calves had lesser IgG concentrations at 12 h (24.40 and 22.59 g/L for PL and SL, respectively) compared with CON (28.47 g/L). Meloxicam treatment did not affect BW. Calves that received PL tended to gain length at a faster rate (0.24 cm/d) than those that received SL (0.19 cm/d). Meloxicam treatment did not affect MR intake, time of consumption of MR, total dry matter intake, or feed efficiency. Meloxicam-treated calves tended to consume more starter (560.4 and 515.4 g/d for PL and SL, respectively) than those that received CON (452.6 g/d). Ketone levels tended to be greater in meloxicam-treated calves (0.15 and 0.17 mmol/L for PL and SL, respectively), suggesting improved rumen development compared with those that received CON (0.12 mmol/L). Meloxicam treatment did not affect plasma urea nitrogen . Glucose concentrations of calves that received PL (73.2 mg/dL) were less than those that received SL (83.3 mg/dL). Results of this study suggest that meloxicam given at 0 h offers positive effects on starter intake, and possibly rumen development, of preweaned dairy calves. Treatment PL, as compared with SL, offered positive results for rumen development, indicated by lower blood glucose levels.",

Parturition, during which a calf is ejected from a controlled, sterile environment into an external environment (Murray and Leslie, 2013) , can become more distressing depending on environmental conditions (Uetake et al., 2014; Murray et al., 2015a,b,c) , intervention from staff (Dufty, 1973) , fetopelvic disproportions, and calf presentation (Mee, 2008; Murray and Leslie, 2013) . Such complications can result in injuries such as fractures, umbilical ruptures (Szenci et al., 1988) , asphyxia, hypoxia (Grove-White, 2000) , respiratory and metabolic acidosis (Szenci, 1982) , aspiration pneumonia, edema, or bleeding (Poulsen and McGuirk, 2009) . These have been observed to disrupt immunoglobulin absorption (Martin et al., 1975; Olson et al., 1980; Besser et al., 1990) and interfere with natural behaviors of the calf such as maintenance of homeostasis (Murray et al., 2015a,b) and the ability to stand, move, and suckle colostrum (Mellor and Stafford, 2004) .",

Following meloxicam treatment, mitigation of inflammation associated with stress and injury inherent to parturition resulted in improved health and performance of calves (Murray et al., 2015a,b,c) . Therefore, it was hypothesized that meloxicam-treated newborn calves would have improved ability to absorb IgG provided by colostrum replacer (CR).

These findings are congruous with research by Todd et al. (2010) , in which it was reported that calves treated with meloxicam after the onset of diarrhea consumed more starter than those treated with a placebo (P < 0.01). Calves from another study that were administered meloxicam orally following dehorning were reported to spend more time at the feed bunk on 2 of the 6 d that they were observed (Theurer et al., 2012) . Interestingly, meloxicam has a half-life of only 26 h in bovine plasma; therefore, attribution to the drug for improved starter intakes observed over the entire 6-wk period is difficult to state. However, Murray et al. (2015a) found that neonatal calves treated with meloxicam had greater improvement in vigor (P = 0.02), and better health scores from birth to 6 wk, compared with calves that received a placebo, which could have affected intakes. Meloxicam-treated calves in the study by Murray et al. (2015a) showed a greater suckling response than placebo-treated animals, which may have improved motivation to drink throughout the preweaning period, resulting in greater milk intakes. It is therefore conceivable that healthier, more vigorous calves are more likely to exhibit vigorous feeding behaviors.",

Meloxicam treatment did not affect PUN concentration; however, in accordance with improved starter intake, calves in the current study treated with meloxicam also tended to have greater concentrations of circulating ketones (P < 0.10; Figure 2 ). This is expected, as consumption of solid feed results in the establishment of anaerobic microbiota in the gut (Baldwin et al., 2004; Khan et al., 2011) . The coupling of both inhabitation of microorganisms in the gut, and increased solid feed intake, initiates the fermentation of fiber and other carbohydrates present in solid feeds, and the absorption of VFA (Quigley et al., 1991) . As ruminal microbes break down and utilize nutrients from carbohydrates in the feed, less carbohydrate becomes available for digestion after the rumen. Therefore, the amount of glucose available to the animal from the diet declines, and the energy supply of the animal shifts from glucose to VFA byproducts of fermentation (Baldwin et al., 2004) . During this transitional period of development from preruminant to ruminant, blood measures for glucose will decrease over time (Rice et al., 2019) . At the same time, BHB, a ketone produced for energy via the metabolism of VFA, will increase (Baldwin and Jesse, 1992) .",

Instead, no differences were identified between meloxicam-treated calves and those in the CON group. Unlike butyrate, which in growing calves would arise from rumen microbiota, glucose can be derived from other sources, such as gluconeogenesis or uptake from the small intestine. This may explain why glucose concentrations were similar among treatments in spite of a trend for increased ketone concentrations observed in meloxicam-treated calves. On the other hand, calves that received treatment PL had lower plasma glucose concentrations than calves that received treatment SL (P < 0.05). This effect was not observed in analysis of blood ketone concentrations, as results were similar among calves that received meloxicam in pill or powder form. Because of the inconsistencies between glucose and ketone concentrations in calves that received treatment PL versus SL, it is difficult to proclaim that PL resulted in greater rumen development that calves that received treatment SL. Body weights are reported in Table 3 . Average initial BW was 44.43 \u00b1 5.24 kg (mean \u00b1 SD) at birth. Meloxicam treatment did not affect average BW, final BW, ADG, or skeletal measurements. These results were similar to those from 2 studies by Murray et al. (2015a,b) . In the first of those studies, ADG did not differ in calves treated with meloxicam compared with the control. In the second study, 6-wk weight gain was also unaffected by meloxicam treatment; however, calves that were assisted at birth and treated with meloxicam were observed to gain more weight in the first week compared with assisted placebo-treated calves. These results are similar to those reported by Chibisa et al. (2018) , in which 1-to 3-d-old calves treated with meloxicam before transport experienced greater ADG (P < 0.02) compared with the control.",

Alternatively, such variable results reported across different studies and within the same studies may also suggest that weight gain could be a poor indicator of efficacy of NSAID use in calves.

Calves that received treatment PL tended to have greater rates of gain in length compared with calves that received treatment SL (P = 0.07). However, there were no differences in average length, final length, or any other skeletal measurements observed among treatments. Differences in effects between form of drug administration observed in rate of gain in length and glucose concentration could first be attributed to residual meloxicam on the inner surfaces of the bottle when crushed into solution, meaning that calves that received treatment SL may not have ingested the same dose of the drug as calves that received treatment PL. Therefore, if calves that received treatment PL ingested and absorbed more meloxicam than calves that received treatment SL, it is conceivable that a greater effect would be observed in this group, indicated by lower glucose values and greater rate of gain in length. Another possibility for these differences could be attributed to the path of the drug within the digestive tract. Specifically, meloxicam swallowed in pill form is likely to arrive to the rumen, and then pass to the abomasum, while meloxicam crushed into solution with CR will bypass the rumen as a consequence of the reflexive closure of the esophageal groove in response to milk. In the current study, there is not enough data to speculate as to why this difference in pathway through the digestive tract resulted in the observed variability in effect; however, future research should investigate potential causes by considering mea-surements for absorption of meloxicam in the blood, indicators of stress such as cortisol, and indicators of inflammation such as inflammatory cytokines.",
