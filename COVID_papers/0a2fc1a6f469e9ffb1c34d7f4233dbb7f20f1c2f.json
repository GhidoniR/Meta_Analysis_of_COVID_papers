The immersion provided by an HMD can facilitate more natural interaction and thus ease the difference between telepresence and physical presence [10] . Unfortunately, there are several concerns regarding the use of telepresence with an HMD that do not typically occur in telepresence with a Fixed Naked-eye Display (FND, a traditional display such as on a computer or a phone). The velocities that the robot uses or the passing distances to objects and walls, which would otherwise be comfortable in FND telepresence, can be uncomfortable in immersive telepresence. Second, a serious consequence of using an HMD is VR sickness [6] , which can result in the user experiencing nausea and vertigo.",

However, by planning autonomous trajectories for the robot while avoiding motions known for contributing to VR sickness, the feeling of sickness can be decreased without sacrificing the feeling of presence. Additionally, speeds and distances to objects can also be taken into account to make the experience comfortable for the user. Thus, to effectively adapt the robot's motion planning criteria priorities to each user, the impacts of these components on the user must be analyzed. For example, turns have been shown to play a role in VR sickness, [3] , but there is evidence that the duration of the turn is more important than the total angle of rotation [14] . This knowledge was used to plan piecewise linear trajectories for a robot, with rotations in place, which resulted in reduced VR sickness in an immersive telepresence experience [1] .",

These issues are typically not a problem in telepresence through an FND, since it is the immersion experienced through the near-eye displays of an HMD that allow the user to really feel them. These issues are also not frequently studied in pure VR research, since motions in VR are usually either directly controlled by the user, or teleportation is used. Although these methods for locomotion in VR may be more comfortable for the user, teleportation is infeasible in telepresence and manual control is perceived as bothersome in large environments [9] . Thus, there is a need to research autonomous motions to overcome these obstacles in immersive telepresence.",

However, to the authors' knowledge, there is no widely accepted definition of natural motions for mobile robots.

Two of the trajectories were piecewise linear trajectories with 45 \u2022 or 90 \u2022 turns, optimized for the least amount of turns and for the shortest path (see [1] for the path planning), while the third path was a smooth path created with a Rapidlyexploring Random Trees (RRT) algorithm [7] . We selected the RRT because it is commonly used in robot motion planning, it respects the differential drive robot system's dynamics while planning the trajectory in 5-dimensional space, and because there is evidence that RRT paths are considered to be human-like [12] . We asked the subjects to rate aspects of the paths on a Likert-scale, and to select their preferred path, the most comfortable path, and the most natural path.

We also found that, after comfort, preference for a particular path was influenced the most by forward speed and the turns. Preference was strongly associated with the users' perceived naturalness, which was primarily determined by the ability to see salient objects, the distance to the walls and objects, as well as the turns. Participants favored the paths that had a one meter per second forward speed and rated the path with the least amount of turns as the most comfortable. The piecewise linear paths with rotation in place were preferred and selected as the most natural more often than the smooth path where rotation and translation occurred simultaneously.

In order to further elucidate how naturalness is thought of by people interacting with a robot, we asked participants open-ended questions regarding the naturalness of the robot's motions. We examined the answers on why people considered a certain path to be the most natural and found that there seem to be two dimensions (see Fig. 3 ) on which people interpreted the given definition of naturalness, \"how you would have moved through the museum if you were in control\": time frame, and generality. On the time frame dimension, responses regarding either how the robot performed the turns (fifteen comments, twenty-five percent of the total comments on naturalness) or how close to walls and objects the robot moved (thirteen comments, twenty-two percent) can be considered to reflect something more immediate, while comments related to things further in time referred to aspects of the whole path through the museum (fifteen comments, twenty-five percent). Regarding the generality dimension that describes either context-specific or more general behavior, subjects specifically mentioned the museum setting in seven answers spread across all paths, but some comments regarding turning, for example, could be considered as not specific to the context. The two dimensions in Fig. 3 depict a categorization of certain aspects of the answers regarding naturalness when subjects were queried on how they would have moved through the museum if they were in control. Answers about naturalness seemed to generally reflect these two dimensions, though how naturalness is conceptualized will include significant individual variation. Furthermore, it should be noted that these answers are a expression of what participants though of as natural in a particular context, the virtual museum. Whereas some answers were specific to this setting (\"I would visit one side first and then go to the other side of the museum, slowly exploring. So the first one was more natural\"), others discussed naturalness more generally (\"the walking speed was closet [sic] to my own\"). Although the situation in which these answers were generated was quite distinct, the authors believe that people think of naturalness on these two dimensions in many other cases and situations, which our subsequent work will examine.",

Also, it simulates the hesitation of a visitor when going in around a museum\") versus how they consider themselves to move more generally (\"Walking through a corridor in straight line felt more natural than it was in the first path where the movement was from one corner towards another\"). Researchers can also consider that the naturalness of parts of the path like the speed and how the turns are executed (\"This speed is more natural for a scenario or location such as this. However, the turns were a bit sharp and you feel like you're too close to the objects\"), or the whole path that is taken (\"It felt most like a path that an actual human would take, getting closer to inspect the paintings\"), can each be considered to exhibit naturalness or a lack thereof. All of the individual pieces of a trajectory may be construed as natural or not natural in conflicting ways, so there does not seem to be one universal method to categorize robot motion as natural or not. Therefore, care should be exercised in the third-party classification of the naturalness of robot motion; indeed what a roboticist designing the motion or a reviewer reading the paper might assess as natural may be quite distinct from what a general member of the public may appraise as being natural. Thus the best determination of naturalness is, therefore, attained through the evaluation of research participants.",

            "text": "Future work will will test these same trajectories through the museum, except without any artwork present. Since many people regarded path qualities to be related to their ability to see objects in the museum, the artwork had a significant impact on the subjects' responses regarding preference, comfort, and naturalness. In contrast to the first study with the art, we hypothesize that the turns will still have the largest impact on comfort, and that the path with the least amount of turns will be the preferred path when moving through an empty room. We also postulate that the least turns path will be rated as the most natural because it is piecewise linear. The resulting comparisons will further elucidate how naturalness is conceptualized more broadly and will provide further clarification on user preferences from a first person perspective regarding turn speed, forward speed, trajectories, and comfort for the physical movements of immersive telepresence robots.",
