Neutralization antibody titers highly correlated with IgG titers to full length S, S-RBD, and N (R 2 =0.586, 0.632, and 0.4643, respectively; Figure1K). We found that children who presented with minimal disease had variable levels of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies ( Figure   1J ). Children with MIS-C had higher neutralization titers compared to children with severe COVID-19 ( Figure 1J ), which is consistent with higher serum IgG titers against full length S ( Figure 1A ) and S-RBD ( Figure 1B ) in children with MIS-C.",

Although this observation will require further study, we suspect that this finding may be due to a longer time since onset of infection in children with MIS-C relative to children with severe COVID-19. We could not formally investigate this possibility, since many of the patients with minimal COVID-19 and MIS-C did not recall a specific exposure or disease symptoms. Children who presented with severe COVID-19 reported a median of 5 days since symptom onset (Supplementary   table S1 ). Our previous studies indicate that adults with severe COVID-19 possess higher titers of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD antibodies compared to adults with milder disease (17, 18) . It is interesting that only 2 of 9 pediatric patients with severe COVID-19 had detectable IgG antibody titers against the S-RBD protein. One of these seropositive patients presented with severe COVID-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 10 days post symptom onset in the setting of pre-existing hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and eventually died from cardiac causes (19) . The other seropositive patient presented 4 days post symptom onset A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 9 and had a history of adrenal insufficiency due to panhypopituitarism and presented with hypotension leading to respiratory failure, in the setting of multiple co-infections including rhinovirus, adenovirus, and a radiologically confirmed osteomyelitis. Several children in all three phenotypic categories had co-infection, and the role of co-infections in COVID-19 is an important area for future investigation.",

Detailed case studies of 6 of the 10 children with MIS-C (CD12, CD18, CD19, Ct) values of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR were significantly lower in the pediatric patients presenting with severe COVID-19 (median: 28, IQR: 26 -29) compared to children with MIS-C (p=0.002 in one-way ANOVA) (Supplementarytable S1). Similar to other reports (3), we found that children with SARS-CoV-2 had systemic inflammation evidenced by elevated inflammatory markers, including ESR, CRP, ferritin, and D-dimer(12). The children with severe COVID-19 and MIS-C also displayed elevated pro-and anti-inflammatory plasma cytokines(4,5,8). Finally, B-type natriuretic protein (BNP), a marker of cardiac inflammation, was higher in the children with MIS-C versus the severe COVID-19 group, with the difference approaching statistical significance (Supplementary table S1).",
