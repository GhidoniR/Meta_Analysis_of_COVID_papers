            "text": "Stress is a state of threatened homeostasis (physical or perceived threat to homeostasis). In this state, adaptive compensatory responses by the organism might be activated to sustain homeostasis (Pac\u00e1k & Palkovits, 2001) . Psychological stress occurs when individuals perceive that environmental demands tax or exceed their adaptive capacity (Cohen et al., 1995 (Cohen et al., , 2007 , which can trigger stress responses in many areas, such as emotions (e.g., fear, anger, helplessness and hopelessness), cognitions (e.g., confusion, dissociation, difficulty concentrating, etc.), physiological responses (e.g., insomnia, increased heart rate, anxiety, fatigue, etc.) and interpersonal relationship issues (e.g., suspicion, isolation, sense of abandonment, etc.) (Friedman, 2015) . Studies have shown that public health emergencies, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the 2009 H1N1/influenza A epidemics, caused acute stress responses in people, which generated negative emotions (e.g., fear, anxiety and anger) (Bai et al., 2004; Carmona et al., 2016; Tam et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2005) . Stress also affects sleep, including sleep-wake patterns, wake after sleep onset (WASO) and sleep architecture, by affecting the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Lo Martire et al., in press; Sanford et al., 2014) .",

In contrast to nocturnal sleep, daytime napping usually lasts from 15 min to 2 h (Dinges, 1989 ). An appropriate nap can not only reduce the level of subjective and objective sleepiness but also improve cognitive function and behavioural performance, such as short-term memory and emotional control (Brooks & Lack, 2006; Evans et al., 1977; Jones, 2009; Tietzel & Lack, 2001) . Although daytime napping might be beneficial, long naps lead to sleep inertia, which affects subsequent cognitive and emotional functions. In addition, long naps negatively affect the duration and pattern of nocturnal sleep (\u00c5Kerstedt et al., 1989) . People's schedules would be more flexible at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, providing conditions for daytime napping or alterations in daytime napping time. Previous studies on daytime napping mainly focused on the effects of napping and factors that influence it, but paid less attention to individual differences in daytime napping and daily performance and nocturnal sleep.",

Furthermore, maintaining regular daytime naps as they were before the pandemic effectively reduces negative emotions, enhances learning (working) efficiency and decreases electronic device use Research also indicated that the ability to fall asleep during daytime, sleep quality and benefits accrued from napping may be responsible for the frequency of an individual choosing to take a nap (Milner & Cote, 2009 ",

            "text": "This study has the following limitations. First, because the COVID-19 pandemic is an emergency, the researchers could not precisely collect information before the pandemic. Therefore, this study utilized personal recollection to collect information regarding behaviours and emotions before the pandemic, which to some extent achieves the purpose of exploring differences between before and after the pandemic. However, the bias in memory still exists and the cross-sectional nature of this study cannot accurately reflect the causal relationship between the variables. Second, in the selection of participants, this study only focused on young adults with stable physical and mental health and did not explore the psychological and behavioural impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on people of other ages (such as adolescents, middle-aged adults and older adults) during the stay-at-home order, which could be a research area for future studies. Finally, this study preliminarily explored changes in sleep patterns, lifestyle and psychological well-being during the stay-at-home order and revealed the stabilizing effect of regular daytime napping on sleep patterns, lifestyle and psychological well-being, and provided information regarding maintaining psychological health and sleep health during the pandemic. However, it should be noted that unhealthy lifestyles and negative emotions could also affect sleep adversely. The European Academy for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I Academy) explored individuals' changes in sleep during COVID-19 stay-at-home orders and proposed that reductions in duration of exposure to sunshine and exercise levels, and negative psychological status are the main factors that affect sleep health (Altena et al., 2020) . Another study also suggested that changes in social zeitgebers (such as regular work schedules, social activities and living environments) greatly disrupted individuals' sleep patterns during the pandemic (Cellini et al., 2020) . Future clinical studies and interventions may consider the bidirectional relationship of sleep problems, individual lifestyle and emotions.",

The main effects of the pandemic were significant: F wake-up time (1,929) = 106.02, p < .001; F time falling asleep (1,929) = 22.05, p < .001; F sleep duration (1,929)= 38.14, p < .001; F sleep latency (1,929) = 54.99, p < .001. Overall, wake-up time and time falling asleep during the stay-at-home order were significantly shifted to later compared to wake-up time and time falling asleep before the pandemic (mean wake-up time before pandemic = 8:11 AM, mean wake-up time during the stay-at-home order = 8:30 AM; mean time falling asleep before pandemic = 00:10 AM, mean time falling asleep during the stay-at-home order = 00:18 AM), and sleep duration and sleep latency during the stay-at-home order were significantly longer than before the pandemic (mean sleep duration before pandemic = 8.02 h, mean sleep duration during the stay-at-home order = 8.20 h; mean sleep latency before the pandemic = 22.53 min, Mean sleep latency during the stay-athome order = 26.36 min). Additionally, the interactions between the pandemic and weekswere significant: F wake-up time (1,929) = 122.50, p < .001; F time falling asleep (1,929) = 34.71, p < .001; F sleep duration (1,929) = 34.79, p < .001; F sleep latency (1,929) = 13.23, p < .001. Under the stay-at-home order during the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in wake-up time, time of falling asleep, sleep duration and sleep latency on weekdays were significantly greater than on weekends. The detailed results and variation tendencies are shown inTable 4andFigure 1",

Eventually, in the absence of effective countermeasures to cope with stress, these two groups The difference in wake-up time on weekdays was not entered into any regression model.Data results are kept to 2 decimal places. *p < .05. **p < .01. ***p < .001.Moreover, naps of long duration might lead to severe sleep inertia that negatively affects daily performance(\u00c5Kerstedt et al., 1989). evidence indicated that daytime napping and nocturnal sleep seem to affect each other mutually. Studies have suggested that long naps can interfere with sleep architecture, resulting in reduced duration of nocturnal sleep and poor sleep quality due to the increased proportion of slow-wave sleep(\u00c5Kerstedt et al., 1989;Dinges, 1989). Furthermore, increased daytime napping causes reduced sleep pressure at night. Therefore, more time is required to accumulate a sufficient sleep drive to initiate sleep, causing a delayed sleep rhythm and increased sleep latency(Lovato & Lack, 2010).Poor nocturnal sleep and impaired daytime function, which in turn could lead to a greater need for daytime napping, create a long-term vicious cycle.The current study focused on changes in daytime napping caused by emergencies and explores the effects of changes in daytime napping on sleep patterns, lifestyle and negative emotions. The results indicated that stabilizing habitual daytime naps after the pandemic could maintain normal sleep patterns, improve learning efficiency and reduce negative emotions during the pandemic. These findings could provide a theoretical basis for future research. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is still present. Therefore, addressing the pandemic's negative impacts is a main concern for school healthcare professionals, social workers and clinical practitioners. Maintaining regular daytime naps may be an effective way to alleviate the effect of acute psychological stress and to prevent and control mental disorders during the pandemic.",
