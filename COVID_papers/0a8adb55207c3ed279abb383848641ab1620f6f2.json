            "text": "Background: Nowadays, there is a paradigm shift in medical education. This shift occurred following the Covid-19 crisis. The world uses digital e-learning to support the public health response to this pandemic. The study's objective was to determine the medical students' acceptance and perceptions of e-learning during the Covid-19 closure time in Jeddah. Methods: A cross-sectional, web-based study was done among 340 medical students from King Abdulaziz University, 2020. A standardized, electronic, self-administered, Google Form data collection sheet was distributed. It included the E-learning acceptance measure (ElAM) containing three constructs, namely: tutor quality (TQ), perceived usefulness (PU), and facilitating conditions (FC). The sheet also inquired about the students' perceptions of the benefits, enablers, and barriers to e-learning. Descriptive, inferential statistics and multiple linear regression analyses were applied. Results: Blackboard and Zoom were the most preferred Learning Management Systems (LMS) by our medical students. The mean score of ElAM was 102.82 \u00b1 24.102. Better achievers obtained significantly (P < 0.001) higher scores in all ElAM constructs. About three-fifths of the students confirmed that e-learning substituted classical on-campus learning and was an adaptable, and less time-consuming method. The educator's good e-learning skills, the subject, instructional design, interaction, motivation, and good LMS were agreed as enablers of e-learning. However, most students accepted that clinical teaching is the most challenging learning outcome and that exams could be affected by low internet quality. Conclusion: Medical students moderately accepted e-learning during the Covid-19 Pandemic closure time. More training of the students and tutors, better designing e-courses, more interaction, motivation, and blended learning are recommended.",

Concerning the preferred LMS, to the easiness of use, 48.2%, 47.1%, 1.5%, 0.9%, and 2.3% of them chose the Blackboard, Zoom, Team, Hangouts, and other programs, respectively. Regarding rating of students to their distance e-learning experience (comparing to on-campus learning, 18.2%, 31.8%, 17.4%, 18.5%, and 14.1% of them rated it to be much lower, lower, at the same level, better, and much better than on-class teaching, respectively. Table 1 shows that the overall score of ElAM ranged from 21 to 147, with a mean of 102.82 \u00b1 24.102. The TQ total mean score was 39.34 \u00b1 10.14, the total PU was 44.11 \u00b1 11.52, and FC was 19.36 \u00b1 5.85. The lowest value was for FC-3, while the highest level was for PU-2. Table 2 indicates that females obtained a better mean score of FC (19.84 \u00b1 5.86) compared to males (18.52 \u00b1 5.76), with a statistically significant difference (Student's t-test = 2.01, P \u2264 0.05). However, there is no gender difference in the other constructs. Students in the clinical-years obtained a better score on the TQ construct than others (P < 0.05). On the other hand, there are no significant associations between age and ElAM. Better achievers obtained significantly (P < 0.001) higher scores in all domains of ElAM compared to others. Those who gave a better or equal rating score to e-learning compared to on-class learning had significantly higher total ElAM and higher three construct scores (P < 0.001). Similar findings are also revealed regarding the students who rated the e-learning as not being a bad experience. After controlling confounding factors in multiple-linear regression analyses, Table 3 displays the predictors of the ElMS and its three constructs (TQ, PU & FC). Regarding the total ElMS, the good students rating of their overall e-learning experience during the closure time (B = 3.304; 95% CI: 1.779, 4.830), higher GPA, and the better or equal rating of their e-learning experience compared to on-class learning were the significant predictors. The table also showed that the same predictors and the academic year (B = 2.258; 95% CI: 0.351, 4.165) were the TQ's predictors. Table 4 shows that about two-thirds (66.2%) strongly agreed and agreed that course material was always delivered on time. Furthermore, about three-fifths (59.7%) of the participants confirmed that e-learning substituted the classical on-campus learning during the Covid-19 pandemic. A similar percentage (59.2%) also agreed that online learning was adaptable and less time consuming than classroom learning. More than three-fourths (76.4%) of medical students agreed that interaction was present between the medical tutor and students during their last online course. Furthermore, 54.1% and 49.1% of the participants agreed that they were motivated to e-learning and that assessment was fair to them, respectively. Table 5 shows that about four-fifths (79.4 %) of the students strongly agreed and agreed that the educator's good e-learning skills could enable the learning process. Similarly, 78.8%, 77.7%, 74.7%, 73.2%, and 72.0% agreed that the subject of the e-course, sound instructional design of e-learning course, motivation, the efficiency of communication, and a friendly LMS were enablers of e-learning. About two-thirds (67.0%) agreed that the provision of e-learning as an integral part of the learning process (blended learning) is an essential enabler of the future e-learning.",

So, students have more control over the learn-ing content and time [3] . Concerning the perceptions of medical students regarding the benefits of e-learning, the results of the current study found that about 60% of the participants agreed that e-learning substituted on-class learning during the closure time. A similar percentage accepted it as an adaptable and less timeconsuming method. Similarly, the Jordanian study reported that the main advantage of e-learning, from the perspective of their students, was saving time [3] . Bediang, et al. found that most of their students perceived the potential effect of e-learning [21] . Similarly, Gaikwad, et al., [22] reported that their students well-perceived interactive e-learning in the pharmacology module. Nesterowicz, et al., 2014 , notified the acceptance of e-learning by pharmacists from Poland during their continuous pharmacy education [23] . Barteit, et al. conducted a mixed-methods study by introducing elearning through a blended approach and showed a high agreement (>75%) with such a method [24] . Their higher findings than the current study may be due to their practical training and application of blended learning.",
