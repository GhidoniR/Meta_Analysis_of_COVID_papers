The aim of this article is to present the view of our European endocrine societies on the care of patients with rare endocrine conditions. Methods We evaluated the current situation of patients with rare endocrine disease and present the joint views of the European Society for Endocrinology (ESE) and the European Society for Pediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) on how the endocrine disciplines can support and contribute to a better health of patients with rare endocrine conditions in Europe. Results Rare diseases pose many challenges, including early diagnosis and innovative treatment options. Rare endocrine diseases can be found among inherited disorders, cancers, and conditions associated with metabolic disorders such as diabetes, calcium and bone metabolism, lipid metabolism, hypogonadism, and adrenal, pituitary, and thyroid dysfunction. According to the European Registries for Rare Endocrine conditions, there are over 440 distinct rare diseases that affect the endocrine system. Rare endocrine diseases are often chronic and life-threatening. Conclusions ESE and ESPE support a strategic plan to address unmet needs in the area of rare endocrine conditions. The EU should continue to evolve and expand its plans for funding European Reference Networks so that they can expand their activities.",

Despite their rarity, these conditions collectively affect~30 million people across Europe [2] and come with particular challenges related to time to diagnosis, investment into research and access to innovative treatment options. Due to the limited amount of strong epidemiological data, the real prevalence and incidence of many of these rare diseases is not known. Rare endocrine diseases include inherited disorders (e.g., congenital adrenal hyperplasia), cancer (e.g., multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes), and conditions associated with metabolic disorders such as diabetes, calcium and bone metabolism, lipid metabolism, hypogonadism, and adrenal, pituitary, and thyroid dysfunction. According to the European Registries for Rare Endocrine [3] conditions there are over 440 distinct rare diseases that affect the endocrine system [4] .",

ESPE developed a Covid-19 hub on its website (https://www.eurospe.org/patients/espe-covid-19-hub/) for children and adolescents with life threatening rare endocrine disorders, including diabetes mellitus type 1. Similar initiatives should be stimulated across the EU to obtain a better understanding of the links between rare (endocrine) diseases and COVID-19.
