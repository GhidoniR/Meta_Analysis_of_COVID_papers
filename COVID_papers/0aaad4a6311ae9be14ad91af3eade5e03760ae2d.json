The digitalization also affects the size and complexity of the infrastructure and therefore makes it more difficult to gain an overview in order to secure the entire power system from attackers. One method of how to gain an overview of possible vulnerabilities and security threats is to use threat modeling. In threat modeling, information regarding the vulnerabilities and possible attacks of power systems is required to create an accurate and useful model. There are several different sources for this information. In this paper we conduct a systematic literature review to find which information sources that have been used in power system threat modeling research. Six different information sources were found: expert knowledge, logs & alerts, previous research, system's state, vulnerability scoring & databases, and vulnerability scanners.",

Without the access to electric power, the consequences can be severe, for example, hospitals being unable to operate. It is essential that the security of power systems is kept, especially when they are added to the communication infrastructure as part of digitalization. One method of ensuring the security of the power system is to gain an overview of its vulnerabilities by creating threat models. Threat modeling is a method of assessing security of systems and is further described in Sect. 3. Threat models are suitable for power systems because current security assessment techniques for enterprise IT environments might not be available for power systems. Power systems combine Information Technology (IT) with Operational Technology (OT) and there is often a combination of legacy and new techniques as well as equipment.",

In that paper \"SCADA\" and \"risk assessment\" were used as keywords to find articles between 2004 and 2014. The authors found 24 articles according to these criteria. The difference between that study and this one is that they focused on all types of SCADA systems and on risk assessment. Cyber security risk assessment can be considered a broader term than threat modeling because the risk can be assessed by other means than with threat modeling. For example, it can be assessed by mathematical formulas. Another difference between cyber security risk assessment and threat modeling is that in risk assessment, the consequences of an attack are also taken into consideration. Even though the focus of that paper was not information sources, they presented it as part of their results. The authors found two different possible information sources, expert opinion and historical data. This is in contrast to this literature review paper where historical data was not mentioned in any of the articles and many more information sources were found. In addition, the different potential information sources were discussed in the article, indicating that the authors were aware that more than the two found by them exists. Nazir et al. performed a survey for the techniques used to assess vulnerabilities of SCADA system [32] . Their survey was not a systematic literature review, but rather a collection of the most commonly used techniques including threat modeling. Some of the techniques that they discuss can be considered as information sources, for example using monitoring and test beds. They also discuss tools that can be used for gathering information. These tools are scanning tools, penetration testing, machine learning, Intrusion Detection System (IDS), Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), honey pots, Security information and event management (SIEM), ethical hacking and forensic science.",

According to his paper, the attack goals, attacks against those goals and the values of the nodes, that is, the difficulty of the attacks, are required to build the attack tree. This type of information to build attack trees or any other type of threat model can be found by using several different information sources. For example, one can derive the information from vulnerability databases, industry experts or base it on previous attacks. It is important that this information source is reliable so that the resulting threat model can be trusted. The threat model may be used to make decisions of where to assign the most resources to protect the system depending on the result and any mistakes could be costly.",

The CVSS is a scoring system that was developed by and maintained by Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST). The authors in [21] , outside the scope of this review, found that using CVSS alone does not perform well as an information source for threat modeling. While the authors in [24] found that in general CVSS can be trusted. In addition, their results also showed that if one considers all of the systems vulnerabilities and not only those with the highest CVSS score, the results were much more reliable. Some papers found in this review use a combination of calculating their own CVSS scores with vulnerability databases or other information sources [9] [10] [11] . Another example of a scoring system is the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system that also calculates a score for the weaknesses or vulnerabilities 2 [35] . The CWE includes all software weaknesses and not only vulnerabilities.",

One downside of using the vulnerability scoring and databases is that this information has the possibility of bias. This is because there are experts who use their experience and knowledge to estimate properties that give vulnerabilities a specific score. It is difficult to know exactly where the articles gain the information, they might phrase it as \"vulnerabilities can be found in vulnerability databases, for example X,Y,Z\".
