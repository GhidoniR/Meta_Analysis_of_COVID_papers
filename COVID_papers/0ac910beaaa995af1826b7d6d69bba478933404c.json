            "text": "Sri Lanka, being an isolated island in the southern tip of India, usually experiences extreme weather patterns with two peaks of rainfalls in two monsoon seasons (Department of Meteorology, Sri Lanka 2020). Particularly the south-western monsoon from May to September brings rain to the southwest mountainous area of Sri Lanka. Out of 25 administrative districts in Sri Lanka, ten districts, approximately 30% of the total land area of the Island, have been mostly prone to landslides. Landslides had previously been perceived as isolated events, which occurred mainly due to natural causative factors with low vulnerability. However, these areas had long been the major area of tea and cinnamon plantations, being occupied by about 35% of the population of Sri Lanka. Moreover, the post-civil-war Sri Lanka have been attracting tourists with 5 of 7 UNESCO cultural and natural world heritages of Sri Lanka located in the landslide-prone areas. Studies have revealed that nearly 70% of the landslides in Sri Lanka are influenced by human induced interventions in prone areas such as rapid urbanization, population growth, inappropriate land management, development trends, deforestation in steep slopes and degradation of forests and natural resources. One of the most remarkable disasters to be mentioned took place at Aranayake in Kegalle District, 70 km east of Colombo (JICA Survey Team 2016). The fluidized landslide mass ran over a 2 km distance killing 125 people. This tragic event has thus highlighted the importance of sophisticated early warning and disaster management mechanism, because the presence of these hidden unstable soil masses as well as their long run-out distances are very difficult to predict, and once they start sliding, it is almost impossible to stop them.",

This landslide is unique in that it is much bigger in size and its runout distance than the others. Though this type of landslides rarely occurs, a large RRLL can surely cause a big disaster. This landslide mass ran across two local communities, Elagipitiya and Debathgama Pallebage, having populations of about 1,500 and 1,100, respectively.

From this perspective, we use MSSG as our generic platform for precise weather forecast. MSSG, standing for Multi-Scale Simulator for the Geo-Environment, is a coupled non-hydrostatic atmosphereocean-land model developed at the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) (e.g., Takahashi et al. 2007 Takahashi et al. , 2013 Onishi and Takahashi 2012) . The developers of this MSSG join the research activity of G2 to help develop the rainfall prediction system suitable for Sri Lanka. The Yin-Yang grid system (Fig. 5) is used in both atmospheric and ocean components of MSSG. This grid model looks exactly like a tennis ball with two identical skins stitched together, thus the grid spacing becomes quasi-uniform allowing seamless zoom-in and zoom-out to be made anywhere on earth. On this MSSG, precise topographic effect and boundary-layer turbulence effect (Seifert and Onishi 2016) on the cumulonimbus clouds development particularly over upwind slopes can be taken into account for the better 24 h-in-advance prediction of heavy rainfalls in Sri Lanka.",

It is also worth verifying the feasibility of currently available numerical tools for evaluating how persistent rains would trigger a RRLL and how the fluidized soil mass of the RRLL would run out. Therefore, soil samples were taken from the source area of the Aranayake landslide (Fig. 7) for a series of undrained ring shear tests (Fig. 8) . Given the parameters from the undrained ring shear test, a numerical tool, SLIDE (Liao et al. 2010) was first employed to reproduce the porewater-pressure buildup in the time domain, and then LS Rapid model ) was used to simulate how the landslide soil mass at Aranayake was detached and how the fluidized soil mass did run over that long distance of about 2 km (Fig. 9 ). These models for simulating infiltrations and fluidized soil dynamics need to be refined as we obtain much more pieces of information on site to be sure. However, the good agreement between the simulated and the observed runouts suggests that these tools will potentially be helpful for pursuing this project.",

Each district, administered under a District Secretary, is divided into several Divisional Secretary's (DS) divisions, which are further subdivided into extremely many local communities called \"Grama Niladhari (GN)\" divisions. 2. The number of local GN divisions in RRLL-prone areas is increasing year by year reflecting human interventions. 3. Though the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) of the Ministry of D\u00e9fense has sole authority in terms of the issuance of evacuation alerts and evacuation orders, each Divisional Secretary (DS) can use his/her discretion in taking necessary actions in case of urgency. 4. NBRO has been helping their decisions providing them with alerting information of landslides. 5. In this regard, both NBRO and JICA has started a joint project \"Project SABO\" (NBRO and JICA 2020), for capacity strengthening on development of non-structural measures for landslide risk reduction. The goals include: (a) strengthening of hazard mapping and risk assessment capacity, and (b) revision of regional-level early warning issuance criteria, etc. Thus, Project RRLL is expected to play a complementary role vis-\u00e0-vis Project SABO, providing proactive information allowing people to take a precaution against RRLLs (Fig. 11 ).",

In this situation, ICL and NBRO are starting this project \"Development of early warning technology of rain-induced rapid and long-travelling landslides in Sri Lanka\" (Project RRLL).

NBRO is currently running one more JICA technical cooperation project, Project SABO for capacity strengthening on development of non-structural measures for landslide risk reduction.
