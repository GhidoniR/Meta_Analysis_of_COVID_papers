An instructor, a program director and five doctoral students in different stages of their coursework and dissertation proposal development, wrote a reflective journal. Participants varied in their levels of familiarity with technology-assisted education, personal backgrounds and circumstances including work and family responsibilities. Participants' journals documenting their reactions, struggles and coping since the abrupt move of the university from face to face to online classes were content analyzed. The analysis was co-conducted by five participants to identify themes and generate understanding of the experience. Two main themes emerged from the analysis: a developmental process of participants' reactions, perceptions and meaning making of the experience and factors that shaped it. Lessons learned are discussed and recommendations for professional education and directions for future research are suggested.",

Schools were forced to move rapidly to an exclusively online teaching mode (McMurtrie, 2020) . This change left students and faculty anxious, confused and deeply concerned (Fan et al., 2020) . The required fast and abrupt transition to online teaching and learning found schools, faculty, and students at different levels of preparedness to address the challenges involved. Main issues included limited students' access to and mastery of technology, insufficient availability of technical support and guidance for faculty, and diverse attitudes towards a completely technology-mediated teaching and learning experience (McMurtrie, 2020) . Further, some field and lab-based courses in biology, chemistry, performing arts and the helping professions were more challenged in transitioning to the virtual world because they require experiential learning.",

Such special issues were due to the experiential teaching strategies that are paramount in practice courses, the composition of the student body and the centrality of field education. The use of experiential teaching strategies such as role play and modelling is a cornerstone in social work courses designed to enhance students' practice skills. The student body in social work is diverse compared to other disciplines and includes about one third non-whites, about 20% self-identified LGBTQ+ (Salsberg et al., 2018) and many carry multiple family and work responsibilities. Field education, which is a critical component in social work programs and requires direct contact with diverse client populations, could not continue because of university and agencies policies, both of which banned in-person interactions with clients whereas opportunities for remote assignments were limited. Some student populations have been even more vulnerable to the impact of the pandemic, which exacerbated societal disparities and inequities. This includes students who were called to provide care for sick relatives, find work to support their families who lost employment and income sources or DACA students awaiting a Supreme Court decision (Weissman, 2020) .",

Online teaching and learning at times of crisis was addressed to a limited degree, mostly in relation to medical education (Lim et al., 2009) . A single report exists documenting the experience of MSW students shifting to distanced learning during a time of a global crisis (Tosone, 2021) . To add to this extremely limited knowledge and include doctoral students' and faculty members' perspectives, this article reports preliminary findings from a qualitative inquiry designed to document the lived experience of teaching and learning social work curriculum during the COVID-19 pandemic. Better understanding of the experience is critical to guiding improvement of preparedness for subsequent disasters (Xia et al., 2020) . Lessons learned from the experience of moving to remote teaching and learning due to the COVID 19 pandemic can inform social work programs' improving their preparedness for future disasters. McNaught (2004) who reported a content analysis of narratives written by staff at The Chinese University of Hong Kong about their experiences during SARS stated, \"It is not a carefully planned research study. How could it be? SARS struck with frightening speed. There was no time to form an elegant multi-faceted evaluation plan in order to examine the changes in teaching strategies that teachers adopted. We all worked with very short time spans and with rapid revisions when plans went awry. It was a time of fear and a time of action. It is the nature of the action that I want to explore\" (p. 194) .

Participants varied in demographic characteristics, including racial/ethnic affiliations, personal backgrounds and circumstances of work, school, family, and caring for sick relatives, as well as levels of familiarity with technology-assisted education. The faculty is a war veteran in her country of origin, which has on-going military conflicts, and the administrator worked in hospitals for 30 years through the AIDS, SARS, MERS and Ebola epidemics, flu and measles outbreaks, as well as was involved with critical incident teams.

It involves participants' describing a recent experience and unpacking its salient aspects such as people, resources and activities. Typically, reflective journals are used in qualitative research to ensure that data collection and analysis are as free as possible of researcher's bias and to improve research trustworthiness. However, in this project, the reflective journals were used as the data to be analyzed. The use of detailed critically reflective journals of thoughts and feelings related to personal experiences, chronicled close to their actual happening through observing the self in situation is common in some qualitative research. Phelps (2005) posits that reflective journals are important data in qualitative research as they provide significant insights into the experience of their writers. The analysis of reflective journals to gain such insight was used in multiple studies. For example, Bashan and Holsblat (2017) used reflective journals of student teachers as a source for narrative research of participants' experience during the development of teamwork in a practicum program.

Routines became more familiar. Several students mentioned that attending classes and thinking about school work became a refuge from the pressures outside. While recognizing that he still performed below the usual level, a student stated \"It is [a written assignment] a short one, and I don't feel great about the quality of it, but I do feel good about having gotten it done and about the prospects of doing more work.\"",

            "text": "Participants reported that their experiences were shaped by social factors such as structured and environmental racism, institutional factors such as growing demands and limited support, available social support as well as the nature of online learning. Racism and xenophobia can be fueled in reaction to public health, financial or security crises (Babacan et al., 2009; Gopalkrishnan, 2013) . Blaming epidemics on the \"other\" is a recurring historic narrative. \"One dramatic aspect of epidemic response is the desire to assign responsibility. From Jews in medieval Europe to meat mongers in Chinese markets, someone is always blamed. This discourse of blame exploits existing social divisions of religion, race, ethnicity, class, or gender identity\" (Jones, 2020) . During the recent COVID-19 outbreak, there have been multiple reports of manifestations of racism towards people of Asian descent (Logie, 2020) . The reports in the journals of a Black and an Asian-American student illustrate this reaction. Institutional factors identified in this project as impacting the experience were somewhat similar to those quoted in previous research as barriers to willingness of helping professionals to work during a pandemic. For example, two studies designed to explore health care workers' perspective on working during an influenza pandemic in the United Kingdom (Aoyagi et al., 2015; Ives et al., 2009) identified both logistic and institutional challenges. Logistic challenges were transport related to difficulties and childcare responsibilities; institutional factors included a lack of trust in, and goodwill towards, the employing organization and the feeling that employers did not take the needs of staff seriously and failed to provide accommodation, sufficient information and guidance. Factors that appeared to contribute to adjustment to the new learning environment were in agreement with conclusions from previous research (e.g. Collings et al., 2019) . Flexibility, good working relationship with the instructor, having progressive assessment through the semester, positive attitude and availability of staff, along with quick decision-making to reduce uncertainty were identified as helpful in addressing students' stress. The faculty was able to provide those informed by her life-long experience of practicing and teaching in the context of an ongoing military conflict. That social support from friends and families eased the experience is compatible with a vast body of literature that pointed to the same in the aftermath of exposure to diverse traumatizing stressor events. In her discussion of the struggle with such events, Tosone (2021) points to the critical role of secure attachment as a protective factor and as an enhancement to resiliency. Participants' journals attest to the significance of the availability of support from their familial and social environments and its contribution to building a community that was experienced as helpful in mitigating the sense of loneliness.",

Specifically, the unplanned, spontaneous nature of the data analyzed allowed capturing the authentic voices of individuals reporting their experiences as they are in the midst of living these experiences, thus avoiding the challenges of memory selectivity and distortion common in retrospective studies. However, this study has several limitations. First, the number of participants in small reflecting the experiences of one group of participants. This N size is similar and even larger than the number of participants in comparable studies (e.g. Alvarez et al., 2005) . Second, participation was voluntary and thus, the entries reflect the voices of those who were ready to share their experiences. A comprehensive future study can provide more nuanced understanding of the reactions of faculty and students to shared traumatic exposure. Third, the abruptness and fast pace of events prevented planning a carefully designed process for data collection and analysis. In addition, students saw and coded each other's entries, potentially allowing their power relationship to impact their coding. Finally, the university where this project was performed is located in what was at the time the urban epicenter of the pandemic in the US and the experiences of students and faculty may not be applicable to higher education institutes in different environments.",

For example, universities and colleges need to develop a well taught through comprehensive protocol for institutional reactions to support emotionally students struggling with the adversities of a collective trauma. Such preparation is especially important in light of the predictions for recurrent global pandemics in the coming years (Daddar & Nirupama, 2015; Oberemok et al., 2020) . Many universities focused on enhancing faculty competence in online teaching. Faculty must also be trained in crisis readiness that includes skills and strategies for addressing students' reactions to distress and its impact on their ability to concentrate, focus and learn. Faculty in departments of social work, psychology, nursing and students counseling centers, especially those specializing in stress and trauma, are positioned in an ideal intersection for playing a major role in working collaboratively to develop a \"response to disaster kit\" for all faculty. Additionally, in light of the importance of social connections that emerged from the reflective diaries, structures for providing peer support, i.e. a \"buddy system\" is indicated.",

Tosone et al. (2003) found that students, who learned that many of their reactions were documented in relevant literature, felt comforted, validated and \"normalized\", ultimately less anxious. Specifically, in universities with a diverse student body, like the one where this project was conducted, it is of utmost importance to make students aware of the role that racism plays in situations of trauma both because of multiple traumatizing experiences of minority groups and the racially-based disparity of access to services. This is critical when the stress related to the pandemic intersects with and magnified by the stress generated by other events such as the national anger and protests following the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, by a white police officer, which occurred during the pandemic. Activities should be implemented to raise and reinforce awareness of the whole community, including students, faculty, administration and staff, to the tendency of racism and microaggression to intensify during crisis. Training in strategies to address these responses should be implemented.",
