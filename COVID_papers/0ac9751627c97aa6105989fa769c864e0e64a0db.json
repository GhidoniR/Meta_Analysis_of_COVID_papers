            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) is an acute respira-Q7 tory illness with systemic manifestations caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. 1, 2 Main symptoms are fever, fatigue, dry cough, and myalgia, which can progress to dyspnea or, in more severe cases, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). While most adults with COVID-19 recover, a minority develop ARDS requiring hospitalization. 3, 4 Approximately 80% of patients have mild illness, 15% have moderate to severe disease and 5% have critical illness. 3, 5 Hydroxychloroquine has generated interest and great debate as a potential treatment for COVID-19 due to widespread availability, low cost, antiviral and immunomodulatory activity, and established safety profile from historical use for other indications such as malaria and autoimmune diseases. 6, 7 in vitro, hydroxychloroquine limits entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells and late stage viral replication. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Furthermore, hydroxychloroquine reduces production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines potentially involved in the development of ARDS among infected patients. [12] [13] [14] Associated with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine was suggested to decrease SARS-CoV-2 viral load in non-randomized studies. 11, 15 Based on these mechanisms of action and clinical experience early in the pandemic, hydroxychloroquine was used as a treatment for COVID-19 in some settings and discussion regarding its efficacy is still in course. 16 Treatment of COVID-19 with hydroxychloroquine has been recommended in many treatment guidelines, including in China, France, Italy, Netherlands, South Korea, United States and in Brazil, where national regulatory agencies have authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine in hospitalized patients. [17] [18] [19] Our primary aim was to assess the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin in terms of clinical and biochemical outcomes in adult patients with COVID-19 hospitalized for mild to moderate ARDS. Secondary aim was to describe the occurrence of adverse effects potentially associated with the therapeutic regimen.",

No statistical significance was found in clinical and in the majority of biochemical outcomes. Our groups were comparable since the majority of baseline variables analyzed were similar between groups. We only found differences in age, percentage of pulmonary involvement (but not in the number of pulmonary segments affected) and also in baseline CRP, which were all lower in the treatment group. Even in younger patients with milder pneumonia and lower CRP, hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin was not effective in these patients hospitalized for mild or moderate COVID-19 related ARDS. In general, this combination was well tolerated, but in almost 8% of treated patients it was withdrawn due to QTc prolongation. In other studies, several protocols of hydroxychloroquine administration have been used for mild, moderate and severe cases. In a quaternary center, 811 patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, defined as resting oxygen saturation of less than 94%, were treated with hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin for five days and 565 were not treated. 20 Although hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were more severely ill at baseline than the control group, authors did not find differences between both groups regarding intubation or death in this observational study. Moreover, in a similar retrospective study done at a French university hospital, authors studied lower doses of hydroxychloroquine alone in mild, moderate and severe COVID-19. No significant reduction of the risk of unfavorable outcomes (death, transfer to ICU) was observed with hydroxychloroquine in comparison to standard care. 21 Furthermore, in an impressive large multicenter retrospective study that included 2541 patients, authors analyzed if hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin, or neither drug, was associated with in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. Some patients had severe COVID-19 needing intensive care treatment. In this study, hydroxychloroquine was used as prescribed at our hospital, but azithromycin dose was lower than that used in our study. The combination of hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin was reserved for patients with severe COVID-19 and minimal cardiac risk factors. They found that hydroxychloroquine alone or in association with azithromycin was associated with reduction in COVID-19 mortality with respiratory failure as the primary cause of death. 22 However, this has not been confirmed in subsequent clinical trials.",

The only baseline significant differences between our study groups were lower median age, lower percentage of pulmonary involvement (with no difference in the number of affected lung segments) and lower CRP in the active group, which could ameliorate the results of the active treatment. But this was not seen. Similar results were found in an open-label, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, entitled COALITION COVID-19 BRAZIL I. In this trial, authors assessed whether hydroxychloroquine, alone or in combination with azithromycin, would be effective in improving clinical status in the same levels of disease severity (mild to moderate), but with more time of active treatment (seven days). 26 They did not find any significant difference in clinical outcomes among groups. They found more frequent adverse events in patients who received hydroxychloroquine, either in combination or alone, regarding QTc prolongation and increase in liver-enzyme levels compared to patients who did not receive either medication. In our study, we did not find any difference regarding liver enzyme levels, but we found greater CRP and LDH peak values during follow-up, which suggested more systemic inflammation in the course of the disease in the active group. Our findings are also consistent with recent published meta-analyses assessing the outcomes of COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine as monotherapy or combined with azithromycin that showed no benefit in mild to moderate disease. [27] [28] [29] The study has some limitations such as its retrospective nature and smaller sample size compared to other studies, but has the strength of having homogeneous groups regarding baseline variables, including comorbidities and previous medications used, not evaluated in other studies, which had permitted a fair comparison between them, with better reliability of our findings. Also, we used a clear standardized protocol for treatment and all patients were from a single center in a single health system, in which the same medical teams had treated the patients.",
