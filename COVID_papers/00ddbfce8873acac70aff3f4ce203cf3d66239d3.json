This article reports on a study that investigates the impact of teachers' professional experience and transparency of textbook activities (due to materials design) on teachers' actual perception of the transparency of materials. The study adopted a mixed-methods design and collected quantitative data via a five-point scale survey from 115 secondary school teachers as well as interview data from 15 informants. Data analysis reveals that both teachers' professional experience and transparency of textbook activities affect the degree of easiness teachers perceived as they understand and interpret the activities for pedagogical purposes. However, discrepancy exists between transparency in materials design and transparency in teachers' perception. Lack of pedagogical knowledge about the relationship between teaching objectives, steps, and assessment and strong existing cognitive schemata developed from the stereotype of processing a familar set of teaching materials might hamper teachers' perception of transparency.",

Teachers' understanding of textbook activities, for instance, that of the designed learning objectives and suggested learning process, informs their instructional design and classroom teaching (Ren and Han, 2016) . Besides processing noticeable features of textbook activities that entail pedagogical instructions and suggestions, teachers also actively interpret textbook compiler's intentions that underlie explicit descriptions of activity procedures (Bao, 2016) . Therefore, it is important to more closely examine how teachers understand and interpret textbook activities, given the present paucity of research in this strand.",

A key property of such presentation is the transparency of activities, that is, the degree of easiness for teachers' to process and comprehend activity procedures as well as pedagogical considerations that underpin the procedures (Xu, 2010) . When teachers can easily understand their procedures and intentions, activities are considered transparent, while less transparent activities are more difficult to comprehend and interpret. Research shows that transparency of textbook activities is determined by comprehensibility of learning objectives, specificity of learning steps, and assessability of learning outcomes, all of which are manifested through presentation of textbook activities (Xu, 2021) . Therefore, when activities are so presented as to allow teachers to easily identify intended learning objectives, sort out suggested learning steps, and implement classroom assessment, they will possess higher transparency.",

They, however, have rarely focused on teachers' response to textbooks in cognitive terms, or more specifically, how teachers' understanding of textbook activities is jointly influenced by teachers' experience and transparency of textbook activities. As experience and transparency combined should constitute a more holistic picture, it is worth more research endeavors to reveal how these two variables contribute to teachers' understanding of textbook activities in interactive ways. Therefore, the current study, as a pilot for a research project on a larger scale, explores the impact of the interface between experience and transparency. The research question this study aims to answer is: How is EFL teachers' understanding of textbook activities influenced by teachers' experience and transparency of the activities?",

The researcher first selected 10 samples of teaching materials for reading instruction, each including a narrative text as well as a complete set of pre-, while-, and postreading activities (i.e., a warm-up activity to introduce the topic or theme to the learners, a series of activities to train learners to identify and understand information as well as pragmatic features of the text, and a series of activities to help learners internalize key vocabulary and grammar). All of the 10 samples were chosen from English textbooks for the 8th grade approved by China's Ministry of Education but not used in Guangdong Province where all the participants were teaching. The 8th grade is the 2nd year in junior high school in China, commonly seen as a more representable year than the 1st year (featuring transition from primary school to secondary school) and the 3rd year (featuring heavy emphasis on preparation for the entrance examination to senior high school). Nine experts were invited to rate the 10 samples with scores (1-5) on the transparency of their activities in terms of teaching objectives, steps, and assessment; that is, each expert produced three corresponding scores for each of the samples, the mean score of which was then calculated. Three of the experts were university professors specialized in research on EFL teaching in schools, three were expert junior high school teachers, and three were senior editors from publishers that compiled EFL textbooks for schools. The samples with the highest and lowest mean scores were finally selected as sample materials to be used to elicit teacher participants' evaluative responses.",

Results showed that transparency and experience both significantly influenced the evaluation scores and that interaction between transparency and experience was also significant. LSD post hoc multiple comparisons among the three experience cohorts showed that expert teachers rated significantly higher than experienced teachers (MD = 0.706, p = 0.000), that expert teachers rated significantly higher than novice teachers (MD = 0.623, p = 0.000), and that experienced and novice teachers did not rate significantly higher or lower than each other (p = 0.109). In other words, results demonstrated that expert teachers rated significantly higher than experienced and novice teachers on the transparency of sample materials. However, in the aforementioned multiple comparisons, highand low-transparency samples were not treated separately in statistical analysis, so it was necessary to split them and to determine if expert teachers rated both of them significantly higher than others. ANOVA was thus conducted to examine the impact of experience (expert/experienced/novice) on the rating of the high-transparency sample and on that of the lowtransparency sample, respectively. Results showed significant impact in the case of high-transparency sample (F = 164.371, p = 0.000) and no significant impact in the case of lowtransparency sample (F = 1.030, p = 0.360).

This meant that expert teachers seemed to be more inclined to rate the high-transparency sample material as of high transparency, while experienced and novice teachers failed to do so.",

The two sample materials were chosen from textbooks that the research participants did not use in their own teaching. This may explain why all of the interview informants confirmed that they did not remember reading or using these activities and that 14 out of the 15 interview informants particularly mentioned that the materials were not from the textbooks they were using. Interestingly, although teachers of different experience approached the low-transparency material in similar ways and most of them considered it difficult to understand and interpret, they approached the hightransparency material in quite different ways as is shown in the following typical responses: As this is a lot different from our own textbook, I need to refrain from my habitual way of looking at textbooks . . . I should stand in the shoes of the compiler to see what they would like students to achieve with the whole bunch of activities as well as with each of them. (expert teacher) I find the materials weird . . . The activities are arranged in a strange way. And in my class I don't usually ask reading comprehension questions that way . . . I find the logic unclear between adjacent activities. (experienced teacher) I can vaguely understand the teaching objectives of the activities, because they [the objectives] seem to be the same as those in the textbook I am using in my own teaching . . . I don't understand how these activities should be done so as to achieve the objectives. I'm quite confused about that.",

(expert teacher) As can be seen from this extract, teachers might need certain knowledge to be able to figure out the inherent pedagogical logic embedded in the activities of the textbook. Therefore, it is quite likely that it is lack of pedagogical knowledge that made the hightransparency material look less transparent than it actually was to novice teachers, and that it is the inflexible mind-set of processing teaching materials that prevented experienced teachers from utilizing such knowledge as well as the high transparency of the new material in understanding and interpreting it. Compared with experienced teachers, expert teachers demonstrated a much stronger awareness that existing schemata in their cognition might influence them as they processed new materials and consequently succeeded in removing the effects of stereotype that hampered the perception of transparency.",

This corroborates with previous research that examines the relationship between transparency of textbook activities and their accessibility for teachers in pedagogical processing (Xu, 2010 (Xu, , 2021 . More importantly, the current study has revealed the impact of teachers' experience on their perception of the transparency of textbook activities: discrepancy may exist between transparency in materials design and transparency in teachers' perception. Two factors have been discovered that may hamper teachers' perception of transparency: lack of pedagogical knowledge about the relationship between teaching objectives, steps, and assessment (as is the case of novice teachers in this study), and strong existing cognitive schemata developed from the stereotype of processing a more familar set of teaching materials (as is the case of experienced teacher).",

For instance, the participants came from economically better-off cities, making them less representable considering situations in less developed areas in China. Despite the limitations, the study still carries some implications. First, more research efforts are needed to further address the interface between textbook features in design and teachers' perception of them in reality. That is to say, teaching materials should not be studied as detached from their use in context (Xu, 2010; Tomlinson, 2012) . Second, some educational reforms such as the implementation of a new curriculum may often involve replacement of textbooks. The way teachers view and use new textbooks is quite likely to be influenced by their previous experiences of using earlier ones. This also needs to be taken into consideration as a potential source of influence or even hindrance as the reform is progressed. Last but not least, experience, usually operationalized by the number of years in service, should always be treated as a complex construct that may encompass various psychological traits.",
