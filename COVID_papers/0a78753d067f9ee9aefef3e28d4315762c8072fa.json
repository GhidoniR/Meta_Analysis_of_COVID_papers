Findings of a recent study suggest the transmissivity of the novel coronavirus is significantly decreased among patients who retest positive after recovery from COVID-19 [3] . Several studies on IgG and IgM antibody responses in COVID-19 patients and SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding have been performed [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , but further information is crucial to better understand the epidemiological characteristics of this virus. In the present report, we describe a patient with mild clinical manifestations of COVID-19 who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 for 53 days based on RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab, as well as her husband who also tested positive for the virus but had a shorter positive period despite a more moderate presentation of symptoms.",

A positive swab test after the resolution of symptoms suggests the possibility of reinfection through household transmission. Among members of the same household, a retrospective case series in Wuhan, China involving a total of 155 household contacts of 85 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 revealed a 30% rate of transmission [2] . The wife potentially could have been exposed to the virus and reinfected in the time her husband remained symptomatic. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM antibodies are detected in the early stages of infection and their levels are significantly reduced 4 weeks after onset of illness [4] , therefore the detection of IgM antibodies in the wife over 7 weeks after initial onset of symptoms and 3 weeks after her recovery supports this hypothesis. The husband who had tested seropositive for anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM antibodies on day 51 still tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid via nasopharyngeal swab on day 52, indicating that he could have remained infectious.",

Although both patients' RT-PCR results on nasopharyngeal swab repeatedly returned positive, it is unclear whether the test reflects an actively contagious infection versus detection of viral load. Factors such as patient age, sex, prior medical history, and type of specimen obtained may all contribute to the duration of viral shedding [5, 6] . Elderly age has been found to be an independent factor associated with prolonged viral shedding of SARS-CoV-2 [5, 6] . Furthermore, the results of one study revealed the median duration of viral shedding from sputum specimens and nasopharyngeal specimens was 34 days and 19 days, respectively [6] . These findings have the potential implication of prolonged transmissibility as patients with COVID-19 shed the virus longer in their lower respiratory tracts, particularly among the elderly. Recent data on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among 790 personal contacts of patients who tested negative for the virus after recovering but later tested positive again showed no new confirmed cases from exposure during the re-positive period [3] . This raises the question whether a recovered patient with a PCR-positive sample still remains infectious.",

Current CDC guidelines on the discontinuation of home isolation for persons with COVID-19 offer a symptom-based strategy. Patients who have COVID-19 and are symptomatic may discontinue home isolation if at least 10 days have passed since initial onset of symptoms, and at least 24 hours have passed since resolution of fever without use of fever-reducing medication, and other symptoms have improved [9]. Patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 who never develop any COVID-19 symptoms may discontinue isolation 10 days after their first positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) [9] . The protocol on how and when to ease social distancing guidelines requires a stronger understanding of any potential antibody-mediated immunity after infection. A recent study on the antibody response in laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients show that IgG levels begin to decrease within 2-3 months after infection [7] . In another report, seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies was only 5.0% by point-of-care test on 61,075 participants from 35,883 randomly selected households in Spain [8] .
