Self-report measures (adapted from Pew Internet Survey 1 ) assessed average daily duration of technology use (social media, phone/video calls, video games, TV/movie/videos) 30 days before initial COVID-19-related school closures versus past week. Standard measures for past week anxiety and depressive symptoms (PROMIS) 2 , well-being (WHO-5) 3 , and cybervictimization 4 were used. Use of social media for coping through social connection was assessed using an adapted measure for the purpose of the present study. School status (open fulltime or hybrid versus closed) was determined through the use of the COVID-19 US State Policy Database. 5 COVID-19-related stressors 6 , perceived importance of social media 7 , and demographics were also assessed.",

Selfreported use of social media for coping purposes moderated the association between increased social media use and mental health symptoms; in other words, some social media use may have positive effects. 9 Although much prior research has focused on social media use as a marker of stress, we also found that increased video gaming and TV/movie watching were also associated with internalizing symptoms, in accordance with others' work. 10 Future research should explore in more granular detail what, if any, social media and technology use is protective during a pandemic, and for whom, to help tailor prevention efforts.
