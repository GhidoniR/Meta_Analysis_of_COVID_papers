No country on earth has been untouched by the preemptive creation of a global recession to combat a global disease. Covid-19 has disrupted supply chains, consumption patterns, and business models in a multitude of industries which include a large share of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). SMEs account for the largest share of employment in market-based economies so any discussion of the economic impact of Covid-19 is incomplete without the SME sector. The purpose of this paper is to explore a systems perspective of the Covid-19 pandemic using the absorptive capacity construct.",

First research on crisis management is multidisciplinary, relying on work in psychology, sociology, technology, and economics to describe and explain the impact of a crisis event on organizations. Second, the most informative research relies on systems models although there continues to be work from a single disciplinary perspective, e.g., social psychology, that draw from other disciplines to fill out conceptual gaps (Vegetti & Ad\u0103sc\u0103li\u0163ei, 2017) . Third, and more importantly, they summarize the research in crisis management from an organization level unit of analysis. Accordingly, crises are salient to an organization if they materially affect strategy and structure. Hence, the authors define crisis management strategy as one that steers an organization away from the crisis or mitigates the worse effects of the crisis on the organization's functioning. In their view, and that of other researchers, crisis management comprises the decisions and processes that returns an organization to its pre-crisis equilibrium.",

The question of entrepreneurial responses to economic crises and natural disasters has been an active area of research (c.f., Santos et al., 2021) . We build on this line of inquiry by starting from the assumption that recovery from the crisis is not necessarily a return to a pre-crisis equilibrium. Instead, give the scale and severity of the pandemic, we posit on the long lasting institutional and structure (consumption patterns) changes that point to a reordering (in the Schumpeterian sense) of the opportunities confronting SMEs.",

In a sense, new venture creation in the shadow of the pandemic illustrates entrepreneurship in its purest form, in which the creation of new ventures arises from the needs of society, dissolving the customary divide between social and commercial interests (Williams & Sheperd, 2016; Grube & Storr, 2018) .",

Organizational effectiveness is defined as the continuing ability to survive change without depleting the store of resources. Building on Thompson (1967) , Bourgeois (1981) articulates the construct of organizational slack, which is defined as the financial resources that firms need to respond to environmental shocks. His contrasts organizational efficiency (the ratio of outputs over inputs) and organizational effectiveness, stating that the latter requires firms to operate inside the organizational efficiency frontier. Absorptive capacity extends the notion of organizational slack to include knowledge resources, some of which is embedded in individuals and others in collectives, as the means for adaptation and innovation (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990) . The threads connecting Thompson (1967) to Cohen & Levinthal (1990) are environment change and the firm's resources necessary for reacting and adapting to change. Based on the lineage of the term, we refer to buffering resources as absorptive capacity, even though the original usage of the term refers only to knowledge stores.",

Second, the infection control measures led to sudden (within a quarter) and dramatic slowdowns in domestic economies globally, ranging from 10% of GDP in Germany to over 20% in the United Kingdom. Economic contractions are well known to central banks around the world.

The worse effects are most evident in the service-related industries, in which a large share belongs to small and medium size enterprises (SMEs).Examples include the near-instant collapse in demand for inbound travel and leisure services such as hotel rooms, and tourist attractions such as museums and theme parks (Ozili & Arun, 2020) . Popular destinations in the United States experienced up to 90% shrinkage in inbound traffic in the first two weeks of the March 2020 lockdown order, hitting airline seats, hotel rooms, and restaurant covers (Suzumura et al., 2020) . Airlines around the world parked between 50-90% of available seat capacity, predicting that a return to full operating capacity could be years away due to continuing border control measures (Sun et al., 2020) . Business travel, long the mainstay of airline profitability, is unlikely to return to full demand, given the continuing work-from-home (WFH) policies through at least the summer of 2021 (Bick et al., 2020) , and the increasing acceptance of conducting business meetings via teleconference. These shifts translate into critical impact on tens of thousands of SMEs that compete in the travel ecosystem, from independently owned restaurants and cafes and tourism focused retail to ground transport operators and mom-and-pop accommodation establishments. Commercial real estate values extend their long-term decline as SMEs fail and corporations make permanent their work-from-home policies (Ling et al., 2020) .",

Similarly, entrepreneurship in a crisis is not a process that can be adequately described by the actions of single actors, as is customary in most research on entrepreneurship but rather the interactions among actors, industries, and regions, and their market and political coordinating mechanisms (Bailey & Breslin, 2020; Linnenluecke, 2017) . To understand this process, we first have to acknowledge that the pandemic has led to step changes with long term consequences, in what used to be considered normal activities in daily life. For example, data reveals that routine health checkups that would have led to the early detection of cancer substantially declined during the pandemic, which may suggest higher incidences of advanced stage cancers in later years of life (Lange et al., 2020) . Similarly, school closures may portend the loss of future income. By some estimates a 4-month closure of K-12 schools in the U.S. in the Spring of 2020 created 1.25 trillion U.S. dollars in loss lifetime future income for 76 million students (Psacharopoulos et al., 2020) .

Mass SME failures following catastrophes such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 (Runyan, 2006) , and the Lehman Brothers collapse in the 2008 (Chow & Dunkelberg, 2011) can have long lasting effects on the local communities that depend on them. Some environmental shocks can create such a high level of uncertainty that decision makers are unable to assign an expected value to various outcomes. In these instances, incumbent firms have to manage the dual challenges of reconfiguring existing resources to maximize their productive use or innovating to find new sources of growth. Both activities require firms to be fully engaged in responding to the crisis. Yet, we know that decision-making under conditions of uncertainty is beset by inertia, which driven by the decision makers' knowledge filters (Acs & Plummer, 2005; Acs et al., 2013) . The strength of knowledge filters is the consequence of a firm's absorptive capacity at time of the crisis. Firms with greater absorptive capacity will regard the crisis is an opportunity to pull ahead of the competition. Greater stores of prior knowledge mean weaker knowledge filters and are thus better positioned to identify and exploit the market spaces left by the departure of existing firms or created by new unmet needs created by the pandemic. For others, the uncertainty represented by the crisis will discourage experimentation, particularly because the necessary capital can only be required at a higher discount rate to reflect the higher risk to investors.",

The Covid-19 crisis has led to the uptick in, for example, delivery drivers for e-commerce services, and brokers to connect the supply and demand for personal protective equipment (PPE). Similarly, there is ample empirical evidence showing that entrepreneurial activities increase following disasters like earthquakes (Williams & Shepard, 2016) . However, self-employment and entrepreneurship are not the same thing and absorptive capacity is more likely to explain the emergence of entrepreneurship than the increase in self-employment. According to the literature, self-employed persons are focused on reducing the risk to income whereas entrepreneurs are focused on the opportunity created by uncertainty. In the entrepreneurship literature, risk (known-unknowns) is distinct from uncertainty (unknown-unknowns). Risk can be hedged if one knows the shape of the distribution (mean and variance) of the outcomes, whereas uncertainty cannot be hedged but instead resolved only by effectuating the idea (Knight, 1921) . Hence, the self-employed start businesses to replace lost or at-risk income. The overwhelming part of new business creation caused by the crisis can be regarded as employment substitution. The latter, which forms a smaller part of the population of the self-employed, are motivated by uncertain but significant future profit, and may be driven by self-efficacy, curiosity and creativity and overconfidence as a problem solver.",

The self-employed switches to selfemployment as a means of protecting present income. The entrepreneur is focused on the reordering of means-ends brought about by the pandemic in order to exploit perceived opportunities. For example, a self-employed person may start making masks to sell online as a means of earning an income after being laid off, whereas the entrepreneur may decide that masks may become a permanent feature of face-to-face interactions and therefore proceed to design more comfortable masks that enhance, rather than inhibit, speech and facial communication. 3 The functions that characterize entrepreneurship are discovery, evaluation, and exploitation of business opportunities (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000) . According to the theory of knowledge spillovers, entrepreneurs recognize opportunities based on existing knowledge stores, and previous experiences in related domains. Accordingly, ideas and knowledge created in one organizational context serves as a source of inspiration for the recognition of entrepreneurial opportunities in other contexts (Caiazza, 2016; Caiazza et al., 2020) . These knowledge filters can be seen as the absorptive capacity responsible for the variation of new ideas in an economy, and also explains why incumbent firms may not adapt as quickly or radically as entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurial initiative is the conduit facilitating the spillover and commercialization of that knowledge. In turn, entrepreneurial opportunities are generated not just by investments in new knowledge and ideas, but in the propensity for a subset of those opportunities to be fully pursued and commercialized by entrepreneurs Belitski et al., 2019a, b; Caiazza et al., 2015) . Hence, the combination of entrepreneurial attention, personality, knowledge, and experience held by individual actors is the basis for new value creation.",

This process continually revolutionizes the economic relationships between producers, consumers, and institutions by forcing out less adaptable incumbents to make room for more innovative entrants. From a systems perspective, Schumpeterian innovation is one of endogenous change. But in the case of Covid-19, the shock is exogenous to the system of value creation. What we see in the pandemic is individuals and firms being forced to act entrepreneurially because of the lack of viable alternatives (Amit & Muller, 1995) . For example, white tablecloth restaurants adapting their service models to food delivery is not the consequence of a proactive marketing strategy but an operational reaction due to infection control measures. The consequences for their business models, with high furniture, fixture, and equipment (FFE) costs, are not sustainable but could point the way toward new service models such as distributed kitchens. 5 A large enough shock capable of destabilizing an existing equilibrium leads to means-ends reordering that create new opportunities for entrepreneurs. Then, innovation emerges to fill the voids in a destabilized system of economic relationships (Agarwal & Audretsch, 2020) . In a global crisis, this dynamic is played out across multiple industrial sectors and geographic regions that are connect by trade flows, and ultimately responsible for the emergence of new industries and firms (Bishop, 2019) .",

Other vaccines have quickly followed, mostly developed by university-industry partnerships such as AstraZeneca and Oxford University (UK) or Curveac (University of Tuebingen, Germany) and Bayer (Lurie et al., 2020) . There are at least 2 well known aspects of this story. First, is the speed at which the vaccines were develop would not have been possible without prior knowledge or technological absorptive capacity. The search for a vaccine began in February 2020 after the publication of the genetic sequence of the virus. It was known at the time that the virus is an RNA-based pathogen that infected host cells via a spike protein on the surface of the virus surface. Simultaneously, a novel vaccine discovery platform using messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was in development (Monslow et al., 2020) . In a study published more than 10 earlier, CEO and founder of CureVac Ingmar Hoerr first showed that mRNAs can provide an attractive alternative to peptide and DNA-based vaccines. This laid the foundation for the first mRNA-based immunotherapy (Hoerr et al., 2000) and pointed the way to challenging the 70-year-old technology of growing viruses and deactivating them for use as vaccines. However, development had stalled because there was never a market large enough to justify the costs of the new approach when an existing one was sufficient. It was not until Covid-19 that the economics of the mRNA platform received its first full test, with the first Covid-19 vaccine authorized for use a mere 10 months from bench experiments (Lurie et al., 2020) .",

Taken together, this process nicely illustrates the triple helix model of negotiated interactions among academia, industry, and government. This model explains how new organizational forms, such as incubators, science parks or corporate venture capital that underpin the translation of science to products work to foster the creation of new firms to solve public problems with private means (Etzkowitz, 2002) . The triple helix is a convenient way to understand the government's role, which is to create the conditions for innovation by de-risking the process for private firms that would otherwise face an economic and logistical barrier to actualizing their ideas. Operation Warp Speed turned what would have traditionally been a big government program into a negotiated interaction between big pharma (clinical trials, regulatory management, and production), biotechnology (bench science), academia (clinical trials and bench science), government (financing, regulation) and the military (logistics and distribution).

As a result, EdTech investment grew by 15% in 2020, representing 7.6 billion U.S. dollars of market value. Since then, the world's startup hubs have been developing an ever-growing number of EdTech solutions that find their usage in various places from universities and schools, to remote employee onboarding, and upskilling in the workplace. In 2020, London-based EdTech companies raised a total of 124 million U.S. dollars in VC investment, ahead of Paris with 92 million U.S. dollars and Berlin with 67 million U.S. dollars, making London's EdTech ecosystem the largest in Europe, with an estimated market value of 3.4 billion U.S. dollars. Worldwide, China dominates investments in EdTech, with Beijing in first place and Shanghai in third, while San Francisco and Bangalore come in at second and fourth, respectively. 9 Yet, whether growth in EdTech means greater societal absorptive capacity to innovate is unclear as the effectiveness of online education in K-12 may never be fully understood for at least 2 decades.",

For example, restaurants that invested capital in outdoor dining may not recover these investments due to the rolling lock downs that have now extended to outdoor spaces. 13 Uncertainty increases the costs of investing and many service sector SMEs have chosen to permanently close rather than wait for a stable recovery (Gourinchas et al., 2020a, b) .",

Indeed, the idea of prime pumping the economy to forestall a recession achieved bipartisan acceptance (the Cares Act) due to this line of thinking. We believe that such comparisons are mistaken. By not accounting for the causes of the crisis before deploying the same policy instruments, such as a 3 trillion U.S. dollar cash infusion, we may prolong the road to recovery by propping up already weak companies, creating the conditions for uncontrolled inflation in the future, or redirecting productive (innovation) capital to unproductive (consumption) uses when the latter is unnecessary.",

Not only was the U.S. 2020 Cares Act preemptively passed in March 27, before the full effects of social distancing were felt and only 2 weeks after the pandemic was declared by the WHO, the quantum of the package, at 2.2 trillion U.S. dollars, was breathtaking. The speed, timing, and size of the rescue package was designed to replace the anticipated income loss, and to help SMEs keep their employment rolls. Many countries followed the U.S. example, though to a lesser quantum. It was believed that keeping workers on the employment rolls positively affected consumer confidence and created the conditions for faster recovery. Hiring and onboarding costs of new employees are not trivial for SMEs. These costs are avoided by keeping current employees on the job even if they not working at capacity. More importantly, preemptive fiscal intervention is believed to mitigate a crisis in consumer confidence, which would allow SMEs to retain their investments in productive capital. Even major airlines, some of which parked up to 95% of their fleets, did not initially permanently reduce capacity, choosing instead to use their loan facilities to stay in operation while waiting out the recovery (Budd et al., 2020) .",

This combination of factors is unique and unlikely to be repeated, especially if the general cost of business, such as energy prices, spikes. More critically, because the Covid-19 recession was not caused by a secular contraction of credit or consumption, adding more liquidity to the economy is unlikely to trigger the behavioral changes needed for recovery. For example, no amount of liquidity will make people fly in planes, eat in restaurants, or go to cinemas if they continue to feel unsafe or do not want to be responsible for spreading the virus. 16 Prime pumping an economy already consuming at the productivity frontier in the pre-pandemic era is, by definition, inflationary, which would trigger a structural decline in consumption.",

In addition to education delivery, the widespread adoption of online business meetings, family events and even church going has made individuals increasingly comfortable with this type of interaction. The longer the pandemic lasts the more likely these habits become the norm, creating new opportunities for entrants. Prominent examples including online gaming.

As with all theories, there are limits to which a point of view can be applied to different geographies, industries, and cultures. For example, the political and legal institutions of economy (Common Law versus Civil Law) determine the power of government to impose restrictions on freedom of movement. In an innovative use of its public health authority, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) released an advisory against tenant evictions, on the premise that occupants who end up homeless risk Covid-19 exposure. 26 Such institutional innovations are more likely in laisse faire political systems since they arise from the actions of atomistic policy makers. In centralized political systems, institutional innovation is less likely.",

We have provided reasons why this may be the case but are open to the possibility that status quo bias and inertia of the individual decision maker could invalidate our view.",

Knowing how SMEs behave in one crisis does not necessarily generalize to how they will do to others. A volcanic eruption is a singular event with well-defined outcomes whereas a fast-moving pandemic produces policy responses that are likely create unanticipated side effects, which may be worse than the triggering event. In effect, the more multidimensional a crisis the more unique the combination of proximate causes and effects.",
