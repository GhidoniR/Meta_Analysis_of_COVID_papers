Sustained prohibitions undermine the essential role participating in a faith community plays in improving physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being at a time when wellness is elusive (Shanshan et al., 2016) and erode the social solidarity faith communities create and public health officials rely upon during a pandemic. Demands to immediately reinstate religious gatherings are equally inappropriate. Major faith traditions emphasize the good of a community as often they speak to the individual good.

Public health officials could recognize that faith is a social determinant of population health by engaging faith communities as partners who provide social leadership, build solidarity, and develop the capacity to serve others (Idler et al., 2019) . Faith communities could recognize the expertise of public health officials by translating evidence-based recommendations, such as those offered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, into internal policies and enforcing adherence to them (\"Considerations for Communities of Faith,\" 2020). While many have emphasized the division of church and state, the lived experience of most communities is that church and state are always in dialogue. Faith communities should respect the advice which national, state, and local public health officials have the expertise and authority to offer and public health officials should reciprocate that respect. After all, faith communities are comprised of community members and operate within geographic boundaries. In any pandemic, every faith community will have persons suffering from disease as well as persons who are essential workers tasked with responding to it.",

Most faith communities have liturgies and/or ritual performances, which could incorporate hand hygiene, mask-wearing, and social-distancing requirements during services to demonstrate social solidarity. To further support social solidarity, faith communities could rigorously clean, disinfect, and ventilate buildings before and after worship. When technology allows, faith communities could use on-line sign-up sheets to limit the number of attendees in accordance with local requirements and encourage staff and congregants with high-risk conditions or in vulnerable groups to worship remotely. Congregations who gather in single, large services might choose to pursue multiple smaller gatherings separated in time (i.e., for appropriate disinfecting) or a hybrid model of in-person and on-line worship, and they could appeal to the endurance of faith communities across time and space as a way to explain such hybrid services.",

Dialogue takes time and effort, and it may seem daunting for faith leaders and public health officials; both groups often find themselves understaffed and underpaid. To alleviate the burden of this work on clergy or chaplains and its interference with other religious duties, faith communities could appoint a COVID-19 lead person or team-preferably one with members with formal health training-to provide updates and guide congregants in relevant conversations. This group or individual could also monitor adherence to recommendations, liaison with public health officials, and provide feedback between the two groups.

From March to April 2020, orders for non-influenza vaccines through the Vaccines for Children program decreased by 2,500,000 doses year-over-year (Santoli et al., 2020) .

However, 45 states and the District of Columbia offer exemptions to school-mandated vaccines on religious grounds, even though major religions support vaccination (Grabenstein, 2013), and over a dozen states allow exemptions for philosophical reasons (\"States with Religious and Philosophical Exemptions from School Immunization Requirements,\" 2020). Millions of American children attend parochial and other private religious schools (\"Private School Enrollment,\" 2020), and studies suggest private schools have higher rates of exemptions to school immunization requirements than public schools, with over twice the rate of religious exemptions specifically (Shaw et al., 2014) . Additionally, rates of religious exemptions appear to be increasing; among kindergartners, religious exemptions increased significantly from 2011 to 2018, despite a simultaneous decrease in American religiosity (Williams, et al., 2019a) .

Many have already done so. In 2014, the Catholic Bishop of Orlando, FL-in charge of 79 parishes, 11 missions, two Basilicas, 43 schools, and hundreds of ministries-stopped recognizing religious vaccine exemptions in parochial schools (Noonan, 2014) . In 2019, the Archdiocese of Seattle-representing 73 Catholic schools, 144 parishes, and nearly 1 million members-followed suit, referencing official teaching by the Pontifical Academy for Life and the moral obligation in Catholicism to guarantee the safety of others through vaccination (\"School Immunization Policy Updated to Reflect Catholic Teaching,\" 2019).",

Leaders could use materials published in the academic literature, such as John Grabenstein's 2013 review of \"What the World's Religions Teach, Applied to Vaccines and Immunoglobulins\" (Grabenstein, 2013), as well as other materials-e.g., letters, blog posts, or pamphlets-from individual leaders (Noonan, 2014) or other authoritative bodies within their own tradition, (\"School Immunization Policy Updated to Reflect Catholic Teaching,\" 2019). This work, especially if it addresses school-attendance requirements, routine childhood vaccinations (e.g., measles, influenza, and pertussis), and COVID-19, will be essential when COVID-19 vaccines are available for schoolchildren. Strengthening religious school and daycare vaccination policies will not only protect children and families attending those schools but extend the benefits of herd immunity to disadvantaged community members who lack healthcare access or face obstacles to making appointments.",

Importantly, herd immunity can have collateral benefits. For example, when a vaccine against a bacteria that causes ear infections in children was introduced in the US, the number of older adults hospitalized for bacterial pneumonia declined (\"Vaccines Protect Your Community,\" 2020). For decades, poor and minority children have lagged behind wealthier and white counterparts in vaccination coverage (Bobo et al., 1993; Miller et al., 1994) . Multi-level barriers, such as limited transportation, appointment times that conflict with work schedules, and chaotic home environments for single parents contribute to vaccination disparities (Lannon et al., 1995) . Strengthening school or daycare vaccination policies will not directly address these determinants, but it will improve herd immunity. In turn, herd immunity will protect disadvantaged community members who face numerous obstacles to vaccination and give them additional time and opportunities to receive recommended vaccines.",

It will continue to collaborate with local vaccination experts to host COVID-19 vaccine listening circles at African American faith communities in 2021-2022, funded by ongoing support from the National Center from Advancing Translational Sciences. On a national scale, such partnerships in the pursuit of public health and health equity can be powerful. For example, in 2009, a collaboration between the Interfaith Health Program at Emory University, various Departments of Public Health, and many faith-based organizations around the country helped deliver 13,000-20,000 doses of H1N1 influenza vaccine during our last US pandemic (Kiser & Lovelace, 2019) . Importantly, the doses of vaccines were specifically delivered to hard-to-reach, vulnerable, and minority populations that may have otherwise been overlooked through traditional public health outreach and educational campaigns (Kiser & Lovelace, 2019) . The parallels for preventing COVID-19 circulation are clear. However, while key, these partnerships are difficult to form on large scales and require time, volunteers, and funding to maintain. Thus, faith communities could partner with and financially support ecumenical, faithbased organizations who are committed to public health and justice.",
