We found that neutrophils from severe COVID-19 patients express high levels of CD11b and CD66b, spontaneously produce CXCL8 and CCL2 and show a strong association with platelets. Production of CXCL8 correlated with plasmatic concentrations of LDH and Ddimer. Whole blood assays revealed that neutrophils from severe COVID-19 patients show a clear association with IgG immune complexes. Moreover, we found that sera from severe patients contain high levels of immune complexes and activate neutrophils through a mechanism partially dependent on Fc\u03b3RII (CD32). Interestingly, when integrated in immune complexes, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies from severe patients displayed a higher proinflammatory profile compared with antibodies from mild patients. Our study suggests that IgG immune complexes might promote the acquisition of an inflammatory signature by neutrophils worsening the course of COVID-19.",

Disease severity is associated to the induction of a systemic inflammatory response revealed by the high levels of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, D-dimer, and LDH found in patients with severe COVID-19 [2] . Aberrant immune response in the lung is associated not only with severe COVID-19 but also with a variety of respiratory viral infections including those mediated by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza A virus (IAV) [3, 4] . Neutrophils are the predominant cell type infiltrating the lung during severe RSV infection, and it has been demonstrated that they do not only promote epithelial cell damage and mucus overproduction but also enhance susceptibility to RSV infection [4, 5] . Regarding IAV infection, it has been shown that patients with severe disease show a massive infiltration of the airway by neutrophils and an excessive production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) being both responses associated with fatal outcome in experimental models and humans [6] .",

Consistent with these observations, we found that serum concentrations of ICs were significantly higher in severe COVID-19 patients compared with healthy donors (Figure 3A, right panel) . We then analyzed whether sera from COVID-19 patients might be able to induce the activation of healthy neutrophils in a Fc\u03b3R-dependent mode. Incubation of neutrophil isolated from healthy donors with sera from severe COVID-19 patients resulted not only in the binding of IgG ICs (Figure 3B ), but also in the activation of the neutrophil respiratory burst (Figure 3C) , being this response significantly prevented by a blocking antibody directed to Fc\u03b3RII (Figure 3D) .",

Sera from severe and mild COVID-19 patients were titrated by an ELISA to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (see Methods). In agreement with previous reports [23, 24] , we observed that sera from severe patients showed higher antibody titers compared with mild patients (not shown). By screening a large number of sera, we could select a panel of sera with high (\uf03e1:3200) and low-titers (<1:100) of IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2-antibodies from either severe or mild patients, and analyzed their ability to activate the respiratory burst of healthy neutrophils. High titers of specific IgG antibodies were shown to be associated with a high ability to trigger the respiratory burst of neutrophils isolated from healthy donors. Interestingly, sera from severe patients show a higher ability to induce the activation of the neutrophil respiratory burst when compared with sera from mild patients with similar titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies ( Figure 4A) .",

No differences were observed between the responses induced by IgG antibodies from severe and mild COVID-19 patients regarding neutrophil respiratory burst activation, by contrast a higher CD11b expression and an increased stimulation of CXCL8 production was observed for neutrophils activated by IgG antibodies from severe patients (Figure 4 C and D left panel) .

In contrast, various non-cytokine markers of inflammation and tissue injury such as D-dimer, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are increased in a similar fashion in severe-COVID-19 and other critical inflammatory diseases [27] , suggesting that systemic High numbers of neutrophils have been found in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with severe COVID-19 [8, 9, 28] . Elevated blood neutrophil counts have shown to predict worse outcomes in COVID-19 [29] , while increased concentrations of neutrophils products such as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) [30] , myeloperoxidase (MPO) , and calprotectin [31] have been described in patients with severe-COVID-19. A large body of evidence suggests that NETs play a major role in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. NETs components have been detected in the plasma of patients with severe COVID-19 and correlated with disease severity [11, 32, 33] . Moreover, NET-containing microthrombi with neutrophil-platelet infiltration has been described in pulmonary autopsies from patients died from COVID-19 [32] , suggesting that NETs triggering immunothrombosis is involved in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. Neutrophils could also contribute to thrombotic events in the course of COVID-19 by releasing neutrophil-derived microparticles [33] . They have been associated to thrombosis in different diseases [34, 35] and have been found at high concentrations in the plasma of COVID-19 patients [33] . Interestingly, the activation of neutrophils and platelets in the course of COVID-19 could be induced not only by inflammatory mediators, but also directly by interacting with SARS-CoV-2 [30, 36, 37] .",

No evidence has been published supporting a role for antibody-dependent enhancement of infection in COVID-19. However, IgG antibodies might contribute to disease severity not only by promoting viral infection, but also by inducing inflammatory responses. In fact, studies performed in SARS-CoV/macaque models showed that IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein increases the severity of lung injury by promoting an inflammatory response mediated by macrophages [39] .",

However, different observations suggest that IgG ICs might in fact be involved in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19: a) severe disease is associated with high levels of circulating anti-SARS-Cov-2 IgG antibodies [23, 24] , b) viral antigens have been found in the blood of patients [40, 41] , c) systemic complement activation occurs in the course of severe COVID-19 [42] ; d) severe infection is associated to an exaggerated extrafollicular B cell response [43] , and the production of a variety of autoantibodies directed to red blood cells [22] , platelets [21] , type-I interferons [20] , selfcarbohydrates [44] , self-phospholipids [45] , antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), and anticytoplasmic neutrophil antibodies (ANCAs) [46] . Our present results suggest not only that IgG ICs promote neutrophil activation in the course of severe COVID-19 but also that ICs might play a role in the induction of the systemic inflammatory and thrombotic responses A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 15 associated with severe COVID-19. Interestingly, it has been recently reported that sera from severe COVID-19 patients contain ICs that activate platelets through Fc\u03b3RIIA [47] . Our results also suggest that anti-SARS-IgG antibodies from severe patients express a unique proinflammatory profile when incorporated into ICs. This observation is consistent with previous studies showing that ICs containing anti-spike IgG antibodies from severely ill COVID-19 patients induce a hyper-inflammatory response mediated by monocytes, macrophages and NK cells, due to a reduced fucosylation of the Fc fragment of IgG antibodies directed to SARS-CoV-2, resulting in an enhanced affinity to Fc\u03b3RIII [26, 48] . (A) IgG binding to neutrophils was evaluated in freshly whole blood samples from HD or severe COVID-19 patients, by staining with a FITC-labeled antibody directed to human IgG.",

Some of them show a dramatic increase in the neutrophil expression of CD11b and CD66b as well as in the spontaneous production of CXCL8 and CCL2, while other patients show values comparable to HD. This observation could reflect that severe COVID-19 could progress through different underlying mechanisms involving, or not, the participation of either neutrophils or ICs. Beyond this heterogeneity, our results suggest that ICs might contribute to the induction and maintenance of the inflammatory response in severe COVID-19 patients. Our observations suggest that the administration of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) might represent a useful therapeutic tool to prevent disease progression. In fact, different reports have shown that IVIG treatment improves the course of severe COVID-19[49]. The anti-inflammatory effects mediated by IVIG involve different mechanisms including the blockade of activating Fc\u03b3Rs, the induction of inhibitory signals through Fc\u03b3RIIb, a decreased half-life of IgG autoantibodies due to the blockade of the neonatal receptor for IgG (FcRn), and the neutralization of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and complement components[50]. All these mechanisms might contribute to improve the course of severe COVID-19.",
