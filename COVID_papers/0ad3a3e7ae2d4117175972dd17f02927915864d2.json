In 2005, the people of France and the Netherlands famously voted against the adoption of the European Constitution. Before the EU enlargement of 2004, referenda were held in nine out of ten candidate countries (Slovenia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland and Malta; Szczerbiak and Taggard 2004; C2D 2019) .

Chapter 3 already mentioned French President de Gaulle's plebiscite on Algerian independence in 1961, which put an end not only to the colonial regime but also to the deep divide of the French nation on this question. In some East-European countries, plebiscites were used from the very beginning of the liberalisation process. Whereas the Polish authorities failed to obtain the support of the people when trying to pass early reforms for economic liberalisation, the Hungarian opposition in 1989 won a referendum on the question of election procedure against the wishes of the still communistcontrolled government. These examples illustrate the vast variety of occasions on which people are able to express their preferences. For a better understanding of the different uses made of the devices of direct democracy, a classification according to the following criteria is useful:",

A similar device is the recall, which allows a certain number of voters to demand the removal of an authority or a single person from office. (4) Popular initiatives: A certain number of voters are authorised to demand a popular vote on broad statements of intent or specific measures which they themselves have proposed. Thus, it is a group of people who, acting as 'lawmakers', decide the subject matter and the wording of the proposition to be voted on. 1 Most countries know only the first type, the plebiscite. Under such an institutional arrangement, direct democracy is limited in use and purpose. If it is left to the discretion of the government to put issues before its voters, the referendum tends to serve as an occasional device to obtain wider support for a presidential or parliamentary policy. This is especially the case with non-binding plebiscites, in which the government can realise its projects also if defeated in the vote. A special case is the UK's vote on its continued EU membership held in 2016 (Brexit), which although merely advisory the government had promised to honour whatever the outcome.",

In those cases, a pre-defined class of government decision is always subject to a constitutionally required (mandatory) referendum; and citizens can, by petition, challenge government decisions (optional referenda) or even hand in their own proposals for constitutional or legislative reform (popular initiatives). The difference is that all these devices sanction or correct government policies and politics even when the government might not wish for popular interference. Under these institutional arrangements, direct democracy thus gives citizens an independent voice in politics and policies. This may be in accord with governmental policies, especially in the case of constitutionally required referenda. But the voice of the citizens can be, and often is, also raised against the government. To challenge government decisions in a selective way is the 'natural' use of popular referenda. The idea of 'correcting' representative democracy is further developed by the popular initiative, which allows the people to not only approve or reject government decisions, but also offers a group of citizens the chance to have their own propositions put to a popular vote.",

This unique 'abrogative referendum' was used in the divorce issue for instance, when part of the Catholic population wanted to abolish the secular and liberal divorce law. The Philippine Constitution of 1986 has institutionalised both the initiative and the referendum.

A prominent case are the US States, where direct democracy is as widely institutionalised and used as it is in Switzerland. In all US States with the exception of Delaware, any amendment to the State constitution requires a popular vote. In about half the States we find one or another type of referendum for parliamentary laws, often complemented by a financial referendum. Moreover, citizens in many States can propose legislation by means of the popular initiative, or initiate a 'recall', which allows voters to remove or discharge a public official from office. In no other part of the world but California have citizens had so much opportunity to express their political preferences: from 1884 to 2018, Californians voted on more than 2000 issues. 2",

For Switzerland, we have noted several characteristics of the public sector (the small budget of central government, limited public administration, the modification of a proposed policy programme after its defeat in the first popular vote, etc.) that indicate a high level of responsiveness to the 'will of the people'. On the other hand, the power-sharing coalition of an all-party government can also work as a political cartel and thus reduce responsiveness. Valid comparisons, though, cannot be made. In the US, where comparison with purely representative States is possible, Cronin notes that 'few initiative, referendum and recall States are known for corruption and discrimination. Still, it is difficult to single them out and argue persuasively that they are decidedly more responsive than those without the initiative, referendum, and recall'.",

            "text": "2. As in Switzerland, 'direct democratic processes have not brought about rule by the common people'. In both systems, more than 90% of important parliamentary decisions are not challenged. Popular initiatives alter and influence the political agenda, but do not call into question the role of parliament as the chief lawmaker. At more than 45%, the rate of successful initiatives is higher in the American States than in the Swiss federation (10%) and its cantons (30%) (Linder and Mueller 2017, 328) . But in both countries direct democracy is fraught with inequalities in participation. It is the better educated, older and financially better-off citizen who engages and participates significantly more in direct democracy. Empirical data indicate that the more complicated the procedure and the issues at stake, the more direct participation is socially discriminatory. This selective bias affects the devices of direct democracy, whose specific policy ramifications can be much harder to grasp than simply casting a vote for a person or party based on sympathy or habit (see Chap. 4 and Cronin 1989, 76) . Finally, direct democracy requires citizens to get organised. Cronin states that 'direct democracy devices occasionally permit those who are motivated and interested in public policy issues to have a direct personal input by recording their vote, but this is a long way from claiming that direct democracy gives a significant voice to ordinary citizens on a regular basis'. 3. 'Direct legislation does not produce unsound legislation and unwise or bad policy'. There are strong arguments for this value judgement, despite empirical evidence in both countries that citizens are not always well informed about the issues on which they vote. For the Swiss case, Kriesi's (2005) analyses show that simplifying strategies such as heuristic voting based on cues or party recommendations do not lead to irrational choices. For the US case, Cronin states that the contributions of direct democracy do not essentially differ from those of parliament. As with every procedure based on majority rule, minorities can lose, and this risk, according to Cronin, may even be slightly greater under direct than representative democracy. The same can be said for Switzerland, where recently three popular initiatives gave rise to questions about their compatibility with the Constitution and fundamental rights (cf. also Christmann and Danaci 2012) . But voters in direct democracies 'have also shown that most of the time they too will reject measures that would dimin-ish rights, liberties, and freedoms for the less well-represented or less-organized segments of society' (Cronin 1989, 123 ). Kriesi's and Cronin's arguments, however, compare only direct and parliamentary legislation. How about the fundamental question: does direct participation lead to more or less democratic stability? The quality of direct democracy will depend on the consolidation and quality of democracy as a whole. Even for the consolidated case of Switzerland, there is empirical evidence that direct democracy is ambiguous. On the one hand, it has integrating effects. On the other, it allows political elites to use fundamental societal cleavages for mobilising voters. The latter effect may be detrimental for an unstable, not-yet-consolidated democracy. Germany's regression from a democracy to an authoritarian regime was 'legitimated' by three plebiscites in 1933-1938, and Austria too approved its Anschluss in a popular vote. If Switzerland at that time rejected the popular initiatives of the Frontist movement, an important reason for this was that besides the people, a clear majority of the political elite was also hostile to the idea of fascism (Neidhart 1970, 238-43) .",

            "text": "These historical examples illustrate that direct democracy is vulnerable: instead of contributing to political integration, it may be a factor of de-stabilisation in deeply divided societies and unconsolidated democracies (Linder et al. 2008) . 4. 'Direct democracy can influence the political agenda in favour of issues important to less well-organized interests'. Environmentalists provide a good example of this for California and Switzerland. The popular initiative widens the political agenda and the horizon in respect of what is politically conceivable. We have to note, however, that these innovative effects may become unwelcome. In California, for instance, there is criticism that direct democracy is part of the reason why the state has become 'ungovernable': an abundant number of popular initiatives is launched by a professional campaigning industry that promotes special vested interests rather than those of the ordinary citizens (The Economist 2009). In Switzerland, the smaller 'political market' and lower success rates of popular initiative may have set closer limits to a professional referenda industry. 5. 'Direct democracy tends to strengthen single issue and interest groups rather than political parties with larger, general interest, programmes'. Popular democratic rule partially loses or changes its meaning when devices of direct democracy, originally used by social movements, pass into the hands of interest groups (Hofstadter 1955 , Croly 1914 ; also B\u00fchlmann and Kriesi 2007 , Schneider and Hess 1995 , and Schneider and Weitsman 1996 . The 'normal' form and function of direct democracy are not what they were at the beginning. This statement for Switzerland can be complemented by the US experience that 'Initial achievements or victories were won by the populists and progressives, but the very bosses or interests against whom these devices were aimed soon learn to adapt to the new rules, deflect them, or use them to advance their strategic interests' (cit. in Cronin 1989, 231 ). Yet Cronin, who partially agrees with this critique made by both Croly and Hofstadter, also emphases that special interest and single-issue groups regularly take part in both direct as well as representative democracy. If the US has become a nation of interest groups, it is the very task of politics to blend divergent interests into great governing coalitions. This, in Cronin's view, parliament is best placed to achieve. 6. 'Money is, other things being equal, the single most important factor determining direct legislation outcomes'. It costs money to collect signatures for a referendum or initiative, to create and maintain an effective campaign organisation, to formulate and pass a political message on to voters by direct mail, to finance propaganda and attract the attention of the mass media. The frequent use of the devices of direct democracy has led to the professionalisation of campaigns, an evolution well known in the US and observable also in Switzerland, albeit with a time lag. Unequal distribution of money leads to unequal campaign spending, sometimes up to ratios of 1:20 or 1:50. In Switzerland as in the US States, the high-spending side wins in many cases, yet only in the US do strict rules on financial transparency exist (Garret & Smith 2005) . It is exceptional for underdogs to win against 'big money'. Some American scholars speak of campaign money as the single most powerful predictor of who wins and who loses (Zisk 1987, 90-137; Loewenstein 1982, 505-641) . In the Swiss case, there is evidence that money cannot play the same role with all votations (Kriesi 2009 ). In the case of pre-dispositioned issues, where citizens' preferences are related to first-hand experience and their own values, campaigns have less effect than on non-pre-dispositioned, mostly complex and abstract issues. Moreover, money is absorbed into political parties' campaign strategies, which include not only propaganda but also 'argument based' reasoning to convince voters. Votations cannot generally be bought. But on highly controversial questions with heavy campaigning because of an expected tight vote, money can be the decisive factor (see Sect. 4.5.5) .To a certain extent, money can be substituted by voluntary work of political activists. Together with socially unequal participation, however, the distorting effect of money remains probably one of the most serious deficiencies of direct democracy. First, unbalanced campaign spending devaluates the fundamental idea of a democracy based on 'one person, one vote'. We could draw an analogy with a town meeting or a television debate where one side gets to speak twice, five or 20 times more often than the other side. Second, the risk of deceptive advertising can be greater if there is no counterbalance. Citizens can be prevented from making a fair judgement of the real issue. These deficiencies, however, are not specific to direct democracy. The distorting influence of money (and the media more generally) can also be observed during elections in representative systems, as regular discussions in the US show. The money question is as unresolved in Switzerland as in the US, where attempts to regulate the financing of direct-democratic campaigns have been thwarted in the courts.",

            "text": "1. In the US States, direct democracy is not an element of political powersharing. With their two-party systems, winner-take-all elections and relatively homogeneous majorities installed by a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant hegemony, the referendum has not become a device to permit cultural minorities-African Americans or indigenous peoples, for instance-to gain better access to power or achieve proportional representation. Nor do we know about negotiation processes carried out in the shadow of the referendum challenge, which so much characterise Swiss decision-making. One reason for this might be that US interest groups find it much easier to exert their influence through parliamentary bargaining. Lobbyists in the US legislative tradition can try to get their interests to appear in many bills by attaching their desires as 'riders' (non-germane amendments). This leads to bills that are sometimes a conglomerate of matters such as money for agriculture, schools, highway construction and so on. Non-germane amendments facilitate the finding of 'constructive majorities' between interest groups. In Switzerland-as in other European legislative traditions-these deals would not be possible because different matters must be regulated by different bills. In the US, however, they allow interest groups to influence legislation in a direct way without the 'referendum threat', which anyway is riskier. US States' direct democracy, therefore, is neither an incentive for cooperation and power-sharing as in Switzerland, nor does it have the institutional function of political integration. In turn, because of the strong two-party system, US direct democracy has not devalued elections as the mechanism of government-selection as much as in Switzerland. 2. Direct democracy in the US complements the representative polity, while in Switzerland it has transformed the entire political system. With the introduction of the referendum in 1874, Swiss political institutions-which originally followed both representative and majoritarian ideas-were completely restructured. Majoritarian democracy was transformed into a system of consensus democracy. Negotiated legislation, compromises and permanent power-sharing became necessary if the government was to avoid defeat in referenda. This institutional transformation has not happened in the US. Especially the idea of proportional representation seems to contradict American political culture, which favours competitive elections and 'clear', that is, majority decision. 3 To the Swiss observer it seems as if representative and direct democracy in the American States were much more independent of each other. In terms of political culture, the predominant ideas in Switzerland are participation and voice, while in the US they are competition and victory. 3. In one respect direct democracy is of much greater consequence in Switzerland than in the US. The referendum and the popular initiative are also used at national level. This distinction is important. In Switzerland, not only national but also foreign policy issues can become the object of direct democracy. The latter is even more astonishing as the Swiss Constitution was influenced by nineteenth century doctrines which put foreign policy firmly into the hands of the executive so that it has complete autonomy in its dealings with other nations. In practice, the Federal Council is under much less parliamentary control for its foreign policy than for domestic affairs (K\u00e4lin 1986) . Three constitutional amendments, passed in 1920 Three constitutional amendments, passed in , 1977 Three constitutional amendments, passed in and 2003 , introduced and further extended the people's rights in foreign policy. Today, membership in international organisations and all international treaties implying substantial unifications of law are subject to mandatory referenda (Aubert and Mahon 2003, 1102-20; H\u00e4felin et al. 2016 ). If the government should want Switzerland to become a member of a supranational organisation such as the EU or a system of collective security such as NATO, a referendum is obligatory. The Swiss polity thus empowers the people to participate in matters which used to be the sovereign right of the monarch in earlier times and which have largely remained the prerogative of the executive in most other states (Delley 1999) .",

            "text": "In the US, where the development of modern democracy was accompanied by theoretical debates among the Fathers of the Constitution, the two different strands of direct and representative democracy were present right from the start. On one side were Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, suspicious of government but confident of the common sense of the people. Jefferson, especially, held that the will of the people was the only legitimate foundation of government, and 'wished to see the republican principle of popular control pushed to its fullest exercise' (Cronin 1989, 13) . On the other side, John Adams and James Madison, advocates of informed, wise and responsible decision-making by elected representatives, were sceptical about possible abuses of democracy by an ill-informed, irrational general public. The US Constitution, as a purely representative system with its checks and balances and filters such as the-nowadays purely formal-indirect election of the president, much resembles this model of prudence. Representative government, besides having become the standard all over the world, serves as a normative reference point in much democratic theory of today. And many of the arguments against direct democracy have not changed much since Madison's times: participation beyond elections transcends the horizon and competence of most people, who are not willing to engage in or spend much time on the study and discussion of complex public affairs. The building of consensus, they say, should be left to political elites. The case for direct democracy in modern theory, as represented by Benjamin Barber (1984) and others, can be made on two grounds. The first argument is a critique of the representative model: if representative government is more than an elitist power arrangement, its elected officials must somehow be responsive to their constituency. But on this point the theory of representative democracy was never clear. The debate between 'mandate' (elected representatives have to present their voters' views as faithfully as possible) and 'independent' theorists (the representative's duty is to deliberate free from particular interests and in the general interest of all) is still unresolved. The ambiguity and weakness of the representative model-'thin democracy'-can be remedied only through the direct participation of the people to produce a 'strong democracy' (Barber 1984) .",

            "text": "1. Participation and the problem of social equality: As mentioned earlier, direct democracy is particularly sensible to the unequal participation of citizens, and to the inequality between different groups in gaining the attention of the public at large and in influencing public opinion. Under these conditions, point 7 of Cronin's list may be too optimistic. As Macpherson (1977) mentions, it is hard to escape a vicious circle of the sort that better participation first needs more social equality-and that more social equality in turn requires better participation. Whenever democratic theory makes its normative point about equality in society (Dahl 1989, 323ff.) , it rests mostly on a moral appeal that is unconvincing because of its essential point that democratic procedures by themselves have an equalising effect. In practice, sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. Neither the model of direct nor that of sensible democracy provides a convincing answer. 2. Normative orientation: Cronin's model of sensible democracy does not imply that certain subject matters be excluded from the people's vote. In his concluding remarks, however, he opposes national referenda and initiatives being held in the US, among other reasons on the ground that 'too many issues at the national level involve national security or international economic relations' (Cronin 1989, 251) . We encounter here one of the discrepancies (nr. 12 of his model) between theory and practice. In practice, Cronin makes a good point: military power and negotiation of global terms of trade, on which the 'way of life' of US people depend, may be better left in the hands of a strong presidency and Congress. Thus US citizens, renouncing on direct participation at the national level, may make a rational choice as long as they prefer benefitting from international strength and supremacy. Theoretically, however, there is no reason why the model of 'sensible democracy' should not also apply at national level-at least in domestic affairs. 3. Optimal influence of citizen preferences: The term 'sensible democracy' suggests that institutional arrangements are such that the preferences of citizens have the utmost influence on government politics and policies. Sensible democracy, complementing representative decisions with occasional popular votes, seems to fulfil this criterion. But it depends on additional specificities of the institutions whether the optimum influence of citizens can be achieved, and sensible democracy has many forms. Taking first the Swiss case, we observe a high interdependence between representative and direct-democratic procedures. Because direct democracy is also a means for the political opposition, the referendum challenge enforces legislation by negotiation and power-sharing. As discussed in Chap. 5, proportional representation can devalue elections, however. As to the responsiveness and sensibility of government, there is a clear tradeoff between elections and voting: Swiss citizens lose in 'programmatic control' through elections what they win in 'issue control' through direct democracy. Thus, empirical evidence casts some doubts on whether any combination of direct democracy and representative government can always give citizens optimal influence. Second, there may be other models. Fritz Scharpf, in his Democratic Theory (1970, 54ff.) , provides some strong arguments in support of the idea that enhancing participation in practice leads to a group pluralism that favours the status quo of 'haves' and which eliminates basic reform issues that 'have-nots' need most. He therefore proposes a model that maximises voters' preferences through elections, the simplest and socially least discriminatory mechanism. According to Scharpf, the system most responsive to voters' preferences for structural reform is given by a two-party parliamentary democracy sensitive to small electoral changes, with enough power to overrule resistance by pluralist interest groups. Consequently, Scharpf puts priority for enhancing participation not in the field of political institutions but with society and the economy. 4. Population size-a limiting factor for sensible democracy? Historical experience provides evidence that semi-direct democracy may work not only in a small, 8.6 million country like Switzerland but also in California with a population of some 40 million. But could the practice of referenda and initiatives also work nationwide for the US with over 300 million, or India with 1.3 billion inhabitants? The idea is regarded by many with scepticism, yet the reasons remain vague. Is direct democracy the most vulnerable part of democracy in large countries because of increasing manipulation by big money and the mass media? Or is direct democracy an appropriate way to make central government more responsive? Nobody knows, but one point seems clear: the political culture of direct participation is a collective learning process that needs time to develop, as well as possibilities to correct errors. From this perspective, a bottom-up development from the local via the regional to the national level seems more appropriate than top-down imposition, both in respect of democracy and direct participation.",

            "text": "Sensible or semi-direct democracy, the amalgam of parliamentary decisionmaking by way of referenda and popular initiatives, is not the only way to give people a say beyond elections. In the last decades, direct participation has made its way in different forms from the local up to the national level. If in European countries nationwide plebiscites and votes on EU-affairs have become more and more frequent, this may be seen as the result of strong grass-roots movements that started half a century ago. Civil rights movements in the US, and students and many other populist movements in European countries were dissatisfied with the lack of government responsiveness, challenged elitist politics and claimed more political participation. New social movements, grassroots politics and nongovernmental organisations have made civil society more active in daily politics. Instruments of direct participation, especially at the local and regional levels, have developed in many forms, including advocacy planning, citizens forums, participatory budgeting, panels or citizens networks, to mention just a few (e.g. Ekman and Amn\u00e5 2012). With the development of the internet, the range of mobilisation has drastically increased. The local and the global are more and more interconnected (Tarrow and della Porta 2005) . Direct participation also plays a role for young democracies. In Central and Eastern Europe, we find experiences with direct democracy despite a difficult situation: having to walk the arduous path of developing a civic culture, democratic institutions and a market economy all at the same time. In Brazil or South Africa, landless workers' and farmers' movements are claiming their rights through combinations of direct confrontation and negotiation with government. Decentralisation projects in sub-Saharan countries often go hand in hand with the direct participation of locals in planning and budgeting, including procedures allowing even illiterates to participate. In these cases, direct participation allows for more than people expressing their needs-it is also a device to make people familiar with the functioning of the local state and democracy (Linder 2010) .",

Governing also always implies making decisions for groups and interests which cannot be democratically represented, and which cannot adequately participate. Decisions about the education system, for instance, mostly affect young people who cannot vote yet but are made by adults. Many social reforms, such as of criminal law or psychiatry, need the advocacy of professionals, journalists and other members of an 'active public'. Most importantly, all societies have to take account of future generations. Especially people living in highly industrialised democracies are consuming in a few decades natural resources that took millions of years to develop. Ever-increasing energy consumption and CO 2 -emissions have become a threat to the climate itself. Such long-term effects of industrial activity are neither integrated into the price system of the market nor taken care of in today's democratic procedure. Can we think of finding democratic majorities for decisions renouncing on the short-term advantages of most voters in favour of longterm gains for future generations? Under what kind of political structures dare we hope to see such communitarian and enlightened behaviour? Democratic theory and practice have to face up to such issues (Peters 2019).",

Federalism is therefore a political answer to provide a common biosphere for segmented parts of a larger population. Yet it is only an answer to the territorial segmentation of society, responsive to the cultural autonomy of language, ethnicity, and so on merely to the degree that these cultures overlap with territorial communities. The carp swimming in a school of pike is not protected against being eaten. There is, therefore, a fundamental difference between federalism and plural democracy. While political pluralism also aims at respecting societal diversity and cultural segmentation, it has no connotation for territorial boundaries.

All federations practise different forms and degrees of shared rule and self-rule (Watts 2008, 35ff.; Hooghe et al. 2016) . But this definition is not as clear and distinctive as it seems. A first ambiguity lies in the very word 'federalism', which is sometimes associated with 'centralisation', as in Anglo-American parlance, but sometimes a password for decentralising forces, as in Germany or Switzerland. However, this is not just a question of semantics-federalism itself is fundamentally ambiguous. When at least two territorial entities create a new, common government, they give up part of their sovereignty. This process is not only unifying but also centralising. Once the central government is created, the problem of living federalism may well be to guarantee the territorial autonomy of the components, their differences and therefore their relative independence from each other. As Elazar (1985, 23) put it: 'Federalizing does involve both the creation and maintenance of unity and the diffusion of power in the name of diversity'.",

Elazar's comparative work showed that there are additional dimensions-such as the coincidence of social and political unity and diversity-which can further describe and explain the operation of federalism. This coincides with the observation of cultural differences that exist between the US and Switzerland, even though both figure at the high end of federalism with regard to structure and processes. Already Chap. 3 mentioned that Swiss federalism aims at creating equal opportunities in all regions and at equalising policies among the municipalities. US federalism, in turn, stresses territorial competition of state governments, which gives citizens the choice of 'voting with the feet'. Another cultural difference can be found in the fact that Swiss federalism was conceived to protect territorially entrenched cultural minorities-US federalism was not. This explains why there is not a single federal model, but a rich variety of different types. They depend not only on political structures and processes but also on the history, the specific political culture and the socioeconomic challenges and cleavages present in a polity.",

Without federalism and its principle of dividing power between the new central government and the 'old' cantonal authorities, and without the federal promise to maintain and even safeguard regional differences, this historical process of the nineteenth century would not have resulted in successful nation-building. Meanwhile, religious differences have faded. And even if we can still distinguish German-, French-and Italian-speaking cantons, the language boundaries, which never coincided entirely with cantonal ones, have been penetrated by print, electronic and social media and thus become more fluid. Switzerland today is a comparatively homogeneous society. But the Swiss would never contemplate giving up federalism. Despite complaints about federal particularities that may sometimes become obsolete or troublesome, the Swiss like the formal autonomy of their 26 cantons and ca. 2200 municipalities, which in many respects may be fictive and appear to the foreign observer as an institutional luxury in a country of only 8.6 million inhabitants.",

However, subsidiarity can lead to too small solutions, because the lowest federal level defines what the problem is.

In Belgium, which grants its two segments of French-and Dutch-speakers the utmost autonomy, national unity is said to be fading (Deschouwer 2012) , held together only just by common symbols such as the monarchy, football, chocolate and beer. This reminds us that federalism, giving either too little or too much way to minorities, runs the double risk of paving the way for unitary systems or breaking apart. One should not confound effects and cause, however. Modest success is partly due to the fact that it is primarily divided societies trying to integrate minorities through federalism (e.g. Walsh 2018).

For a single minority group, however, size alone may be of little help: it is always the same (regional) conflict which is at stake, and despite federalism, the same majority will have the last word. Conflicts may accumulate, as for instance in the former Czechoslovakia, which dissolved in 1993. If instead regional autonomy is claimed by several and different kinds of minorities, chances of protection are better: the problem becomes more 'objective', coalitions change, and compensations between different actors and issues are possible. Too great a number of minorities divided up into many units, however, may become a disadvantage. Nigeria, for instance, started with three regions, in 1960; today, not less than 36 ethnic groups each have their own territory. While this may be reasonable from the point of view of a single ethnic group, it lessens the influence of sub-national units over the central government, which can resort to a strategy of 'divide and rule'. 2. Cross-cutting cleavages: A single region may be characterised by several political characteristics, for example, belonging to both a religious and linguistic minority whilst also being relatively poor. In this case, conflicts accumulate, as we have seen in the case of the Jura region, whose predominantly Catholic and French-speaking population also felt neglected economically by Protestant, Germanspeaking Bern (see Chap. 3), and chances of minority protection are less propitious than in situations of cross-cutting cleavages. If a minority region is not poorer but wealthier than others-as for instance the Basque Country in Spain-chances of its autonomy being respected are much more favourable. 3. Effective political majority in a sub-national unit: Federalism only protects territorially segmented minorities, as in a pond which is divided into two parts, one for pikes and the other carp. But a carp swimming in the pikes' part is not protected against being eaten. Similarly, even a large minority cannot benefit from federalism if does not constitute a political majority within the boundaries of at least one sub-national unit. For example, in Switzerland Muslims exceed the population of an average Swiss canton but are dispersed all over.",

This helped foster peace at that time but inadvertently continued the policy of 'ethnic cleansing'. It led to ethnic regions with the risk of creating their own, internal minority problems. With ethnic political parties, the ethnic cleavage and its conflicts may remain the central concern of all politics. To a certain extent, this point thus seems to contradict point no. 3: minorities should be able to constitute a majority in, but not be able to exclusively dominate, a sub-national unit. Yet, this is not a contradiction, rather an unresolvable paradox: every minority protection through federalism creates a new minority problem. After each opening of a Russian nested doll, a smaller Matryoshka becomes the biggest one.

Yet, there are many ways to proceed. While taking part in the deliberation of all federal laws, Germany's Bundesrat has full decision-making powers only in matters with consequences for the L\u00e4nder. The chamber itself is composed of government representatives of the member states. Switzerland requires double majorities in parliament and a popular vote for any amendment to the Constitution, whereas the ratification of amendments to the US Constitution proposed by two-thirds majorities of Congress relies on individually organised procedures of the states, where a majority of three quarters is required. In all these cases important government proposals have to find a double-or 'compound'-majority.",

In other countries, such as the US, with similar population differences between its units, the consequences may be less important because a divide between large and small states is unlikely to happen.

In fact, democratic federations are mostly conceived as multi-level democracies whose constitutions prescribe the same standards of liberal democracy for member states and local governments. In such multi-level democracies, the political rights of citizens-the election of government officials, parliamentary members and so on-have a much greater significance. Not only can voters participate more often, but they can also vote for different parties and persons at different levels. A voter can express different preferences in local, regional and national politics. The frequency of elections provides citizens as well as authorities with permanent information on the popularity of ruling majorities. This phenomenon can be particularly well observed in Germany, where 16 L\u00e4nder governments are elected during one term of the federal government. Changes of power in parliamentary democracies often make their way up and down the federal escalator. In a federation, not only the state but also democracy is closer to the people.",

Participants from Lithuania, Ukraine, Croatia and other places, eager to obtain advice on the then emerging desire for national independence, were somewhat disappointed to hear that neither the Swiss Constitution nor legal scholars had thought much about the question of secession. Meanwhile, the history of Yugoslavia has given a series of answers: the de jure recognition of the first de facto secession of Croatia through West-European countries, the breakdown of the federation in an atrocious and destructive civil war, the secession of what is now North Macedonia by popular vote and, in the case of Kosovo, again the de jure recognition of a de facto secession by several other countries and the international community. While civil war is to be rejected without discussion, the other answers leave many doubts. Should federations regulate secession? Can we think of a 'right' to secede, and if so, what should be the procedure and what would be its consequences?",

At the same time, a federation is conceived as a permanent union-in contradistinction to a confederal system which lacks such commitment.

One region is unwilling to share the wealth coming from its natural resources with others, or inequalities of productivity and wealth are growing instead of diminishing. Another part of the country may feel to be the permanent loser. Conflicts on questions of the economy, language, religion and culture may escalate and end up in deep divides. Once secession becomes unavoidable, a 'peaceful divorce' like the one in Czechoslovakia, where both parts in 1992 agreed to go separate ways, is unfortunately the rare exception.

Thus, it was the popular majority in each district or even commune that defined the territorial boundaries of secession. The region was cut in two-one remaining with the old canton, the other founding its own. Although some political forces on both sides of the new border ended up unhappy, the division at least prevented the creation of a new minority problem: the minority that wanted to stay with the old canton was not overruled and was given the same right to self-determination as the separatist majority. Yet even here, fragments of the conflict linger on: in 2017, the city of Moutier voted anew and decided to join Jura, but the result was later cancelled by the courts because of anomalies during the campaign and voting process.

Yet in most cases, and over a considerable period of time, the two groups remained distinct entities, and what mattered before the law was who the defendant was, not where he was living. Romans were judged by Roman law, the new Germanic settlers by their old Germanic customary law. Both groups regarded this practice as proper and, indeed, as 'a precious safeguard of their respective rights and privileges' (Ra'anan 1990, 14) . With industrialisation and the development of bureaucratic statehood, West-European countries led the way in becoming territorial states. Under the principle of ius soli, the territorial state claims full jurisdiction over its citizens-whatever their origin. Earlier we described part of this evolution for Switzerland. In its religiously segmented society of the nineteenth century, marriage and education were regulated and organised separately for Protestants and Catholics by their churches. Whereas the label 'State Church' has not completely disappeared, churches have by now mostly lost their status as actors in public affairs in favour of the confessionally indifferent state which provides for Protestant and Catholic citizens alike and under the same laws.",

Religious schools, however, were declared non-constitutional by the laic majority of the nineteenth century because in its view these schools violated the separation of state and church.

It is found in the Constitution, in the federal bargain between Protestants and Catholics, in the compromise between centralists and partisans of cantonal autonomy, and in the development of proportional representation-first for the election of parliament, then for the Federal Council, and later for the bureaucracy, expert committees and even the courts. All this gives minorities the opportunity to participate. The law-making political elites, in order to minimise referenda risks, try to arrive at a political compromise that includes all important political groups. Power-sharing provided the solution to the problem of integrating a heterogeneous, multicultural society by political means. It has led to a type of democracy different from others.",

Arend Lijphart (1969 Lijphart ( , 1977 Lijphart ( , 1984 Lijphart ( , 1999 Lijphart ( , 2012 , a prominent scholar comparing political institutions, has called this 'consociational', 'power-sharing' or 'consensus' democracy, a type of democracy different from the 'majoritarian' or 'Westminster' model of democracy (Table 6 .2). 7 These two types of democracy represent coherent and therefore ideal polities maximising the basic ideas of either majoritarian or power-sharing politics. It is easy to identify Switzerland and the UK as two polities that correspond to most criteria of one of the models. The UK systematically favours the logic of majority rule: competitive elections between two main parties based on one major political division (left-right) lead to clear parliamentary majorities. The winner-takes-all rule makes parliamentary majorities sensitive to even small changes in the electorate's preferences; the losing party becomes Her Majesty's Official Opposition. Because of its parliamentary majority, the executive cabinet is empowered to realise its policy programme, as long as there is no successful vote of no confidence, which may necessitate an early election. Power is concentrated among the parliamentary majority and the cabinet. The House of Lords has few competencies; almost all legislative power belongs to the House of Commons. The latter may change constitutional documents in the same way as any other laws, with very few judicial constraints. One may speak of a nearly 'sovereign' parliament, with the main exceptions of devolution of power to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and of some independence given to the Bank of England. A similar coherence of elements, but with the opposite goal of power-sharing and negotiating politics, is found in the consensus model of Switzerland. Lately, both Switzerland and the UK have somewhat moved away from the ideal models in becoming less consensual, the first, and less majoritarian, the latter.",

(Lijphart 2012, 294) With regard to the developing world, we could add a further point: power-sharing helps democratisation. Drawing on Lijphart, Linder & B\u00e4chtiger et al. (2005) developed a concept of power-sharing applicable also to non-consolidated democracies or even authoritarian regimes. In a comparative study of 62 countries from Africa and Asia, they found that between 1965 and 1995, power-sharing and the cultural element of low familism turned out to be the strongest predictors of democratisation. Economic factors-often viewed as the most important variables shaping democratisation-had only limited effects.",

Today, a large majority of the countries considered as sovereign states constitute multicultural societies.

Historical minority problems in industrialised democracies have not faded away, and in Europe immigration has led to new social tensions. Gurr (2000) estimated that at the beginning of the millennium, about 275 minority groups from 100 countries, representing one seventh of the world population, were politically endangered. Instead of classical war between states, we increasingly find armed conflict between different groups in deeply divided societies-such as in Syria, Libya, Sri Lanka or Pakistan, to mention just a few. In many cases, the causes of internal conflict boil down to conflict over resources, but political escalation, alienation and mass mobilisation are often based on cultural difference or intertwined with discrimination (Lake and Rothchild 1998).",

Rather, it evaluates the short-term success of power-sharing agreements as part of the peacemaking process. It is obvious that the transformation of peace-treaties into stable democratic institutions bears high risks and can fail for many reasons. From a vast literature, one can learn that the consolidation of democracy entails a long process also under more favourable conditions than present in war-torn societies. In developing countries, much depends on the existence of a consolidated state, chances for economic development and the compatibility of the cultural heritage with social modernisation (Senghaas 1997; Carothers 1999; Leftwich 1996; Moore 2001; Przeworski et al. 2000; Linder and B\u00e4chtiger 2005) .",

The self-esteem and political recognition of minority groups are an essential precondition for any rational political discourse and accommodation among elites. To promote this objective, proportional representation can be practised in many places: in the electoral system, in parliament, in the executive, in all branches of the administration or also in the police and armed forces. Of course, proportional representation has some pitfalls. Under the conditions of one single minority or a single cleavage, there is a risk that proportional representation perpetuates societal conflict instead of cooling it down. With more than one minority and cross-cutting cleavages, however, proportionality may favour the development of non-ethnic, nonregional political parties, elites and cultures. The evolution from a divided into a pluralist society lets old cleavages fade into the background.",

            "text": "of conflicts whereby minorities have an effective voice. The veto power of minorities does not suspend the formal rule of majority decision. Yet, where minorities are permanently participating in decisions, formal decisions imply negotiation and accommodation, avoiding 'winner takes all' situations and mindsets. For example, right since 1848, French-speakers have always had at least one, most often two representatives in the seven-seat Swiss government (Giudici and Stojanovic\u0301 2016, 297) . The effective voice of minorities depends on two conditions. The first is mutual recognition of the different parts of the political elite. This opens the door to cooperation on a rational basis. On such a basis, solutions turning zero-sum into positivesum games become feasible. Cooperation then is more advantageous than non-cooperation because it leaves all parts better off. The second condition is alternating, issue-specific coalitions. If today's opponent is tomorrow's coalition partner, both are partly dependent on each other. This favours a political culture of mutual respect and support. Empirically, under power-sharing conditions politicians listen more to each other and give more weight to arguments of their opponents than in majoritarian situations Steenbergen 2009 ). Thus, proportional representation and power-sharing are more promising arenas for deliberative democracy. 3. Political cooperation among political elites may encourage general patterns of amicable intercultural relations. Cooperation in parliamentary and executive bodies not only promotes compromises on political issues. It may also, through frequent interaction and mutual dependency, lead to a better understanding between different cultural segments and the development of common values. This process may at first be limited to the political elites, but it can then 'trickle down' to larger segments of society. 4. Federalism or decentralisation may be more effective for multicultural co-existence if combined with other elements of power-sharing. Federalism may be considered a structural element of power-sharing. While restricting the power of the central government, it can guarantee autonomy for different cultural segments in territorial sub-divisions. Like basic individual rights or statutory minority rights and vetoes, federalism is an institutional mechanism restricting majority rule and limiting majority politics. Federalism as a 'vertical' dimension of power-sharing has its deficiencies, however, as we have discussed in the previous part of this chapter. Yet in combination with the 'horizontal' elements of political power-sharing, federalism and decentralisation may become more effective for minority voice and protection (Fleiner et al. 2003) . 5. Consensus democracy rejects the hegemonic claims of a single group and avoids the fallacy of a monocultural nation-state. Consensus democracy is viable only under conditions of recognition of equality of all societal cultures and their groups before the state. Thus, political power-sharing requires a certain acceptance of societal and cultural pluralism. This pluralism must be instilled into the basic concept of the state: the latter must guarantee equal rights to all its citizens and renounce on undue privileges for a specific culture and thus discriminate others. In contrast to the cultural or 'ethnic nation', this amounts to a political or 'civic' conception of the nation (Verfassungspatriotismus, for Habermas 1992) , where citizenship is the only qualification for membership. Such a concept is basically indifferent to the religion, language or ethnicity of its different groups. Of course, every constitutional order, to a certain degree, is characterised by the heritage of a specific culture and its predominant values. The idea of separation of religion and the state, for instance, is realised in different ways and to different degrees in industrialised Western democracies (Madeley and Enyedi 2003). These differences may be greater still in developing societies where ligatures of religion are much stronger. Non-industrialised, traditional societies exposed to outside pressure of accelerating moderni-sation are sometimes even pushed towards relying on religion and other cultural traditions. However, values that symbolise a precious good for one cultural segment may be threatening for another. Such divides can be overcome only by the development of equal rights, mutual respect among all cultural groups and the development of common-or at least neutral-values. Such a collective identity or political culture requires a high degree of indifference or impartiality on the part of state authorities towards particular cultures. 6. The development of a political culture of power-sharing takes time. A new constitution can be written in a few weeks, political parties founded, elections held, and a parliament and government installed in a few years. Successful democratisation, however, takes much longer because the consolidation of institutions, the functioning of the political process, and the appropriate behaviour of actors all necessitate the development of a democratic political culture. In times of global pressure towards accelerated modernisation and quick conflict intervention by the international community, it should not be forgotten that changes in social values, the development of common views among different segments and cultural pluralism are processes of social integration that take time. Even more patience is needed when it comes to power-sharing as a means to overcome societal divides and accommodate deep social conflicts. The wounds of discrimination and civil war take generations to heal (Esman 1990, 14ff.) . More than majoritarian settings, power-sharing institutions incite a 'spirit of accommodation' (Lijphart 1968, 104) , respect, trust or even 'deliberative potentials' (Steenbergen 2009, 287) . But these incentives cannot be accelerated, are even weak and vulnerable. While trust in consensus democracy takes a long time to develop, it may quickly be destroyed by the hegemonic use of power. 7. Consensus democracy provides better chances, but still no guarantee for the peaceful resolution of conflict in multicultural societies. Peaceful conflict resolution in deeply divided societies depends on many circumstances: on the economy and resources, neighbours and foreign interests, on culture and history-and on the political institutions. The latter are just one of many factors. The only proposition here is made with regard to the type of democracy: if the choice is between majoritarian and consensus institutions, the latter provide better chances for the resolution of multicultural conflict. In theory, there are two major arguments against consensus democracy. First, it is said that the political will to share power depends to a great extent on political elites, and that power-sharing can turn into an elitist model of democracy. Second, consensus democracy can be used by hegemonic groups as a veil to hide their real power in giving minorities the opportunity to participate but no substantial influence (McRae 1990) . In this case, which can be observed for instance in the relations between the Jewish majority and the Arab minority in Israel, Ian Lustick (1980) speaks of a 'control model', with characteristics entirely different from the consensus model. Neither argument devalues the consensus model as such-but they illustrate its limits: the consensus model offers better chances or opportunities than majoritarian democracy, yet there is no guarantee that a successful political integration through mutual adjustment will actually occur.",
