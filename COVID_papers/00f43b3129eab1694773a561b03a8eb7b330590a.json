Being highly infectious, this virus poses a grave threat to the global populations associated with a high rate of mortality (Granlinski and Menachery, 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020) . Symptoms linked with this disease include fever, myalgia, cough, dyspnea and fatigue FIGURE 1 | Sequence alignment of COVID-19 3CLprotease and SARS-CoV. The image was generated by Discovery studio. (Huang et al., 2020 and Jin et al., 2020a) . On 30 Jan 2020, the outbreak was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, while on 11 March 2020, WHO has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic (Rodr\u00edguez-Morales et al., 2020; World Health Organization [WHO] , 2020b). Currently, there is still no treatment available for COVID-19 and investigations concerning the treatment of this infection is actively ongoing, especially vaccines (Li and De Clercq, 2020; Rodr\u00edguez-Morales et al., 2020) . Nevertheless, treatments with well-known drugs FIGURE 2 | Superimposed of COVID-19 3CLprotease (red) to SARS-CoV (yellow) .

            "text": "The SARS-CoV-2, belonging to beta-coronavirus that originated from bats has an envelope and sense single-stranded RNA (Perlman and Netland, 2009; Cui et al., 2019) . The virus contains four non-structural proteins: papain-like (PLpro) and 3-chymotrypsin-like (3CLpro) proteases, RNA polymerase and helicase (Zumla et al., 2016) . Both proteases (PLpro and 3CLpro) are involved with transcription and replication of the virus. Amongst the four types, the 3CLpro is considered to be mainly involved in the replication of the virus (de Wit et al., 2016) . A study reported that the main protease 3CLpro of COVID-19 showed 96% sequence similarity with that of SARS-CoV . The adoption of computational methods has been applied in the process of drug discovery, which helped to speed up discovery and design of new drug candidates at a lower cost (Zoete et al., 2009) . Virtual screening-based drug discovery is recognized as one of the efficient strategies that may help in the field of invention and development of new drugs (Sliwoski et al., 2014) . Virtual screening (VS) is a widely used computational approach that evaluates the potential drug candidates in silico. It is used to find different molecular scaffolds that act on a target protein of interest in the process of discovering chemical starting points as novel or potential leads for further optimization and development as alternatives to clinically available drugs. The method employs sequential filters, thus a large number of compounds could be screened to identify the potential lead-like hits for further biological evaluation on drug target in vitro and in vivo (Jacq et al., 2007; McInnes, 2007; Lavecchia and Di Giovanni, 2013) . There are many free databases that offers selection of compounds for VS, one such database is the ZINC database that has 35 millions compounds. These compounds are also available for purchase. The database also provides information on the chemical and physical properties of the compounds such as molecular weight, log P, number of hydrogenbond donor and acceptors, types of bonds and many others (Irwin et al., 2012) . The present study aimed to apply the VS approach to identify potential COVID-19 3CL protease inhibitors retrieved from the ZINC database and FDA-approved drugs, followed by molecular docking analysis to discover novel inhibitors that could be used as potential leads for treatment of coronavirus related infection.",

As can be seen in Figure 2 , the 3D structures of superimposed SARS-CoV and COVID-19 3CL protease showed differences in twelve amino acids, whereby their \u03b1 carbon atoms are of at least 1 nm away from the binding pocket. Additionally, the obtained results exhibited that COVID-19 3CL protease has a Cys-His catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41) consistent with SARS CoV 3CLpro (Cys-145 and His-41) (Yang et al., 2003) . Besides, the alignment and superimposing of the two coronaviruses explained that the conserved catalytic dyad residues Cys145 and His41 existing precisely at similar location in the binding pocket.

In the current study, the conserved residues in the binding pocket of COVID-19 3CLprotease have been targeted to block the virus activity. Initially, 2000 ZINC database compounds were virtually screened using AutoDock Vina, further filtered based on Lipinski's rule of five to evaluate drug likeness of the compounds based on their molecular properties (Lipinski, 2004) . Those compounds that violated at least one of rules were removed. The top four ranking ZINC compounds based on AutoDock Vina scores are shown in Figure 4 . These compounds had the lowest FEB of the protein-ligand complex amongst all ligands; therefore, these compounds were used for the docking calculation.

Among antiviral drug, nelfinavir, which exhibited lowest FEB of \u22128.7 kcal/mol, formed few molecular interactions, one hydrogen bond with Thr26, two sulfur bonds with Met165 and Met49 and Pi-alkyl formed with Leu27, His41 and Met49. Besides, van der Waals interactions were formed with residues Glu166, Leu141, His163, Asp1187, Arg188, Ser144, and Gln189 (Figure 8) . On the other hand, for the anti-malaria artemisinin and clindamycin exhibited similar FEB of \u22127.5 kcal/mol. Artemisinin exhibited only two types of interactions, Pi-alkyl with Met165 and van der Waals with Gln189, Asp187, Arg188, His164, His41, Met49, Leu27, and Cys145, while clindamycin showed two H-bonds with Gly143 and Glu166, and Pi-sulfur bonds with residues Met49 and Cys145. In addition, clindamycin had three pi-alkyl interaction formed with Pro168, His41, and Leu27, and van der Waals interactions formed with the amino acids Thr25, Asp187, Arg188, Glu189, Gln192, Leu141, Ser144, and Asn142 (Figure 8) . For the well-known anti-malaria drug, chloroquine, recently different studies have brought attention to possibilities of using this drug in the treatment of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection (Gao et al., 2020; Li and De Clercq, 2020; Touret and de Lamballerie, 2020; Lee et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) . The docking result of chloroquine showed FEB of \u22126.1 kcal/mol, forming only three types of interactions at the binding pocket, Pi-alkyl interaction with Cys145 and Met165, Pi-Pi T-shaped interaction with His41 As well as van der Waals interaction with amino acids Asp187, Arg188, Gln189, Glu166, His164, and Gly143 (Figure 8) .",

The four compounds namely ZINC33173588, ZINC03231196, ZINC12006217, and ZINC32960814 exhibited high affinity with the 3CLpro binding pocket of COVID-19. The free energy of binding (FEB) were \u221212.3, \u221211.9, \u221211.7, and \u221211.2 kcal/mol while AutoDock Vina scores were \u221212.61, \u221212.32, \u221212.01, and \u221211.92 kcal/mol, respectively. The finding suggests that the four compounds were strongly bound to the 3CL-protease of COVID-19 in comparison with the FDA approved clinically used drugs. The top docking hits passed the Lipinski rule of five and likely to be orally active drug. Sequence alignment showed the similarity between SARS-CoV and COVID-19 catalytic dyad residues Cys145 and His41. The obtained results revealed that the interactions of the compounds with the conserved catalytic dyad amino acids Cys145 and His41 was closer in comparison to that of ligand N3 and FDA drugs. Application of VS and molecular docking could significantly decrease the cost of the drug synthesis and production, subsequently, and provided evidence for interactions of the identified compound with the target COVID-19 3CLprotease. Experimental studies (in vivo) are needed to confirm the findings and to investigate their effects in COVID-19 using an appropriate animal model.",
