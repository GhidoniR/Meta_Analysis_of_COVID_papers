These questions were divided into two domains including 7 questions related to the pharmacy facilities (questions from 1F to 7F) and 8 questions for pharmacy services (questions from 1S to 8S), where F and S denotes facilities and services, respectively. The cumulative satisfaction score was estimated by a 5-item Likert scale with a maximum score of 5 for each item.

Since the quality assessment proportionate with patients'satisfaction, the quality standards of GPP and PC carry substantial importance in healthcare system. The quality of pharmaceutical services is assessed on three aspects including structure, process, and outcome. The structure includes assets and settings, while the process comprises activities, and outcomes include the effects of the care on the individual's health [2] . Satisfaction of patients for pharmaceutical services reflects their preferences and expectations, and the realities of care. It is critical to understand the extent of dissatisfaction for pharmaceutical services [3] . The evaluation of satisfaction will help to identify the specific areas of the service in dire need of improvement and also enhance the positive changes in the current pharmaceutical services. This in turn will provide information to optimize services to ensure clients' health outcomes by addressing their concerns and needs.",

Previously conducted studies were either confined to specialized pharmacy services, limited population, or concentrated to only one center, hereby precluding the generalizability of the findings across the regions. Besides, these studies do not provide an association between demographics and satisfaction levels of the patients. Moreover, there is no study that has evaluated the patients' satisfaction in the northern region of KSA.

The questionnaire was originally developed in English, and then translated into the national language (Arabic). Forward and backward translational accuracy was also ensured. The accuracy of translation was assessed by three language experts and inter-rater reliability was applied to find a proper translation (content validity). The contents of the instrument were pre-tested in a small and targeted sample of outpatients (n = 30) for assessment of clarity and comprehensibility. The alpha value of 0.795 indicated the reasonable level of reliability, adequacy, and internal consistency of the tool. Each section of the questionnaire included closed-ended questions with 5-items Likert scale. Section-I comprised of eight items related to the demographics while section-II consisted of seven questions evaluating the extent of patient satisfaction towards outpatient pharmacy facilities. This section evaluated satisfaction towards accessibility of pharmacy, the number of counters, privacy of counseling area, waiting area, waiting time, availability of prescribed, and other medications. Questions in this section were numbered from 1F to 7F, where \"F\" denotes facilities. Section-III had eight questions related to the satisfaction of patients towards pharmacy services provided to them during their visit to the hospitals. These questions evaluated the satisfaction of study participants regarding courtesy of pharmacy staff, guidance on medication use (dose, frequency), warnings and storage, time sufficiency for counseling, labeling, and overall experience with pharmacy services. All the questions in this section were numbered from 1S to 8S, where \"S\" denotes services. Likert scale was used to grade the satisfaction level among patients. The satisfaction of participants for each item was scored from 1 to 5. A score of 1 indicated \"Strongly dissatisfied', 2 denoted \"dissatisfied\", 3 indicated \"Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied\", 4 represented \"Satisfied\", and 5 denoted \"strongly satisfied\". The maximum satisfaction score was 5 for each item. The average score of all participants was estimated against each item (sum of satisfaction scores against item/total number of respondents). The mean satisfaction score for pharmacy facilities and services was also calculated. The satisfaction score of patients was further categorized into satisfied (score \ufffd 3) and dissatisfied (score < 3). The scoring system adopted in the current study has been previously used in several research investigations [15, 16] .",

However, their overall experience towards the availability of the drugs in the hospital was dissatisfactory (score: 3.46 \u00b1 1.33), where 187 patients reported that they are not satisfied with the availability of drugs in pharmacy.

Overall satisfaction of the patients towards pharmacy services was less than that of pharmacy facilities.

            "text": "The ministry of health in Saudi Arabia has set priority goals to implement the Strategic Plan of General Administration of Pharmaceutical Care. According to this plan, patients'satisfaction is considered a pivotal goal to ensure the optimal pharmaceutical care services. In this context, present study carries several important implications for healthcare policy makers. The results of this study demonstrated low patient satisfaction (mean score: 2.97 \u00b1 0.65) with the 2016) in their cross-sectional survey indicated good satisfaction among patients attending armed forces hospital. In addition, authors found high level of dissatisfaction (score: 1.891) towards the attitude of pharmacy service providers. However, it is pertinent to mention that this study evaluated patients'satisfaction towards the availability and accessibility of drugs in the pharmacy [10] . Since the availability of drugs in military hospitals remains prioritized by the government, it might be a possible reason that patients had higher satisfaction score in their study. On the other hand, Alturki & Khan (2013) estimated satisfaction in a specialized ENT hospital by using self-administered 15-items questionnaire and found good consumer satisfaction [10] . It must be noted that majority of the specialized hospitals remain equipped with state of art facilities, well qualified staff, and better control system which may attribute to the better satisfaction score in their study as compared to our results. These studies vary in methodological aspects and study population which precludes the direct comparison of our findings with them. However, low level of satisfaction in the current study is comparable to international surveys [1, [17] [18] [19] . The global criteria to measure the patient satisfaction varies markedly. Different cultural settings have different needs or expectation that affect the overall satisfaction with the health care services. Moreover, regional development and facilities must be considered while interpreting the results. Al-Jouf province differs by cultural norms as it is a least developed region and has limited healthcare facilities such as expert physicians and pharmacists as compared to the other provinces of KSA which may contribute to the low level of satisfaction among patients. Out of two major domains, pharmacy services scored less (score: 3.91 \u00b1 0.77) as compared to pharmacy facilities (score: 4.03 \u00b1 0.659), indicating unsatisfactory performance of pharmacy departments in the hospitals. Of pharmacy facilities, privacy of the counseling area (item no. 3F) scored less as compared to other six items. These findings are consistent with the results of Ahmad et al. (2016) where lack of privacy for counseling area was primarily associated with the low level of satisfaction among patients [10] . Lack of counseling areas in pharmacies along with inappropriate location of such areas have been demonstrated as a predictor of patients dissatisfaction in various international studies [1, 20] . Since patients counseling is mainstay in disease management, these findings necessitate a dire need of administrative measures to develop appropriate and private areas for counseling to achieve optimal outcomes.",

Drug related problems (DRPs) including side effects, interactions, and low or high dose pose substantial risks of toxicity, suboptimal effect or poor adherence. Pharmacists are poised to play an important role in improving medication management during transitions of care. They have potential to educate patients about the importance of continued therapy and adherence, and also to resolve any uncertainties that patients may have regarding their medications. The low level of satisfaction towards counseling services has been reported in recent studies among patients attending outpatient hospital or community pharmacies [1, 21, 22] . Dissatisfaction of patients for counseling services in the current study might be attributed to less number of pharmacists and pharmacy staff in the hospitals, increased workload, professional in-competencies or lack of continuous education for pharmacy service providers. These findings underscore the dire need of implementation of pharmaceutical care services in outpatient pharmacy department with appropriately equipped human resources. Appropriate number of staff and effective time management could help pharmacists manage their traditional and clinical roles. This aspect is of paramount importance to pharmacy human resource as proper staffing would ensure better performance that could result in increased satisfaction from service and translate into optimal patients'outcomes. The relationship of workload on pharmacists and provision of counselling services has been well discussed in the literature [23, 24] . Current study elaborates substantial associations of patients' demographics with satisfaction levels. Younger patients, female gender, those attending tertiary care hospitals were significantly associated with higher satisfaction score. Unlike other studies [1, 10] , young patients within age category of 26 to 35 years were more satisfied. Most of the study population was comprised of young patients and it might be a possible reason of high satisfaction score among young adults. Moreover, various other studies conducted in KSA where study population majorly comprised of young patients showed no relationship of patients'satisfaction with age [10, 12] . In another study conducted in Spain, age was not significantly associated with satisfaction [4] . Recently, Aziz et al. (2018) found higher satisfaction score among patients with age ranging from 26 to 30 years [22] . The higher level of satisfaction among young adults in the current study might be attributed to lower prevalence of chronic diseases than older patients. Better health conditions in younger patients may also contribute to higher satisfaction as previous studies have demonstrated direct relationship between self-reported health, young age and high satisfaction. It has been well documented that younger patients have good self-reported health and have better satisfaction to healthcare services [25] . Various studies describe complex relationship between patient age and satisfaction scores suggesting that age must be considered as a non-linear factor during the interpretation of satisfaction towards the healthcare facilities [26] . Such discrepancies and ambiguities in existing literature call for more investigations to establish the impact of age on patients' satisfaction. Since current study has small number of elderly patients which preclude us to draw a firm conclusion on association of patient's age and satisfaction, future studies must be carried out by incorporating appropriate sampling technique according to the age of the patients. Unemployed patients had significantly higher satisfaction score than government/private sector employees and students. Though the score was highest among laborers but it did not differ significantly from other occupations in post-hoc analysis. These results coincides with the findings of another study conducted in Ethiopia where authors showed good satisfaction among farmers and patients without any job [10] . It must be noted that satisfaction score was also high among patients without any formal education. It can be assumed that these patients are either laborer or unemployed. The higher level of satisfaction among these patients might be attributed to the low awareness on standard pharmacy services. Moreover, these patients may have lower expectations from healthcare system than educated or employed patients. Similar findings were observed by Kamei et al. (2001) reporting higher satisfaction score in unemployed patients [27] . However, our results are in contrast to a study conducted in ENT hospital of KSA where education levels positively correlated with satisfaction score [11] . Such discrepancies across the literature require further studies for elaboration of the relationship between education levels and satisfaction among patients.",

Similar findings have been observed in another study conducted in KSA, where patients attending both primary and tertiary centers demonstrated good satisfaction [26] .

The low level of patients' satisfaction in primary centers might be attributed to the limited number healthcare staff, diagnostics and management facilities and availability of drugs.",

These findings are in contrast with previous reports where patients with chronic illnesses were more likely to be satisfied with counseling and pharmaceutical services compared to those with acute illnesses [28, 29] . Another study conducted on Saudi population showed no association of patients'satisfaction with the type of illness [23] . Hamann et al. investigated the patients'desire to participate in medical decisions by using Autonomy Preference Index (API) and found that patients with acute conditions have similar API score than those with chronic illnesses [30] . There is scarcity of data exploring the relationship of type of illness and patients'satisfaction towards the pharmacy services. However, our findings corroborate the results of other studies where patients with acute conditions had higher satisfaction score towards hospital services as compared to those with chronic diseases [31, 32] . The higher satisfaction score among patients with acute diseases might be attributed to young age and their optimistic approach towards their outcomes. Tennakon and Zoysa (2014) also associated higher satisfaction among acute patients with their optimistic approach [32] . Since most of the respondents in our study were young adults who scored higher satisfaction, the association of acute illnesses with higher satisfaction might be confounded by the patients' age. In addition, this study contains few elderly patients which further bias the findings due to less representation of chronic illnesses. However, frequent hospital encounters and deteriorating health conditions in chronic patients can be possible factors for low satisfaction. Keeping in view the wide disparity in the available literature and contradicting findings from our study on the relationship of satisfaction and type of illness, a firm conclusion could not be drawn based on presumptive factors. Our analysis demonstrates the dire need of more studies to affirm these findings.",

Supplementing the study tool with specific pharmaceutical care questions will aid to stratify the extent of patient's satisfaction towards traditional as well as extended pharmacy services.
