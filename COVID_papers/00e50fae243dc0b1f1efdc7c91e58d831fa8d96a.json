All rights reserved Besides the two approaches described by the authors, we feel that montelukast can be useful in paediatric patients who could not tolerate or demonstrate a satisfactory technique for or refused corticosteroid nasal sprays. In the management of allergic rhinitis, montelukast is similarly effective to oral antihistamines though less effective than corticosteroid nasal sprays. Nevertheless, montelukast is a potent cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist where it not only acts by directly blocking leukotriene receptors but also possesses anti-inflammatory effects and suppressive actions on cytokine production.",

We nonetheless feel that montelukast should be considered by pediatricians to manage allergic rhinitis amid the COVID-19 pandemic considering its anti-inflammatory action and anti-viral activity.",
