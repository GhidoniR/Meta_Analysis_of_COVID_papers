Whether immunosuppression increases the risk of COVID-19 or has any impact on the disease outcome remains unclear. As there is a paucity of real-world data, evidence-based management of patients with chronic aNMD and MS has been particularly challenging during this pandemic [6, 7] . Consensus guidelines, based largely on expert opinion and experience, were prepared to help clinicians [8] [9] [10] . However, there are no largescale data to date reporting the impact of COVID-19 on patients with chronic autoimmune neurological disorders, in particular those on immunosuppressive therapy (IST). In this study, we have examined the risk of COVID-19 and clinical outcomes in patients with aNMD and MS.",

HCOs are typically academic medical centers and their affiliates. On March 24, 2020, TriNetX fast-tracked updates to its real-world data platform to incorporate specific COVID-19 terminology including the diagnosis and the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) specific coding guidelines to support COVID-19 related research. As a result, \"COVID-19 Research Network\" in Tri-NetX global network of HCOs represents the one of the largest global COVID-19 dataset.

            "text": "There are several limitations of this study worth highlighting, and some of them are inherent to large databases. First, findings are based on reported data, with accuracy verification not being possible. The entered diagnosis may not have been accurate; however, such inaccuracies are likely to be of small scale and unlikely to significantly confound our findings. Second, there are variations on how COVID-19 was tested and some of the COVID-19 patients may just be false positive. Such limitations exist in the majority of reports on COVID-19 [22, 23, 36] , and this is probably unavoidable during an ongoing pandemic. Third, we did not have any data on COVID-19 severity or underlying co-morbidities. We could not directly assess for respiratory symptoms. Fourth, we could not make statistical inferences in some cases where the number of observations were less than 10. The software did not provide a specific number in those cases. Fifth, this is a database-based study. Detailed important patient level information, such as severity of NMD, MS, timing of medication, treatment response, lymphocyte depletion etc. could not be assessed. Lastly, TriNetX covers a large number health care organization, but it may or may not include a particular tertiary care center who are providing care for more serious cases COVID-19. They may have higher intubation, ICU admission, and death, and there are reported variations between outcomes of COVID-19 between hospitals and also countries. While this limitation apparently can falsely reduce the rate of serious outcomes from COVID-19, overall, this possibility gets diluted by the inclusion of a big number HCOs providing care to different communities [37] [38] [39] [40] .",
