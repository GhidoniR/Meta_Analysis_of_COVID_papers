            "text": "Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a clinico-radiological diagnosis of cerebral edema syndrome, chiefly involving the posterior structures including parieto-occipital, posterior fronto-cortical and subcortical areas of the brain. PRES may result from a wide array of insults, the common ones include hypertension, eclampsia and pre-eclampsia, drugs such as cyclosporine and certain infectious causes. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is one of the rare but established causes of PRES [1] . Central structures, including the basal ganglia, brainstem and bilateral thalami, are rarely involved in PRES and often pose a diagnostic dilemma [2] .",

It was associated with two episodes of generalised tonic-clonic seizures. She had a history of recurrent painless oral ulcers and photosensitivity for the past five years. There was no history of prior seizure activity or any chronic illness, prolonged immobility, recurrent abortions, recent surgery, intake of any medication, substance abuse or hereditary thrombophilic disorder. On presentation, she had a poor Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 7/15, bilateral coarse crepitations in the chest and reduced capillary oxygen saturation (80% under room air). The patient was afebrile with a regular pulse rate of 110 beats per minute and blood pressure of 118/74 millimeters of mercury. She had a respiratory rate of 20 per minute and her random blood sugar level was normal. There was no neck rigidity. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal except for sinus tachycardia. She was immediately intubated and mechanically ventilated in the intensive care unit (ICU) in view of her deteriorating oxygen saturation.",

There was a negligible improvement on this treatment regimen. She was then subjected to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, which indicated areas of signal abnormality in the right caudate nucleus, bilateral thalami and left globus pallidus without the involvement of frontal, parietal and occipital lobes in T2-weighted fluidattenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion-weighted images.

It comprises vasogenic edema involving various parts of the brain and the symptoms occur in accordance with the involved structures. Two important theories of pathogenesis include raised blood pressure and endothelial dysfunction [3] . A failure of cerebrovascular autoregulation plays a central role in the pathophysiology of PRES and the resultant vasogenic edema [4] . Acute hypertensive crisis is another common cause of PRES [5] . Although SLE is one of the rare causes of PRES, both these mechanisms can be responsible in SLE as these patients can have endothelial dysfunction as well as raised blood pressure secondary to lupus nephritis [6] . PRES is a rare neurological entity in SLE and must be entertained as a differential in patients presenting with neurological signs and symptoms. Close differential possibilities include osmotic demyelination syndrome, alcohol poisoning and central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis.",
