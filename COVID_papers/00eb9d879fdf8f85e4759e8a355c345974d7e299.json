Reverse transcriptase real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is widely used as the gold standard for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2. Due to technical limitations, the reported positive rates of qRT-PCR assay of throat swab samples vary from 30 to 60%. Therefore, the evaluation of alternative strategies to overcome the limitations of qRT-PCR is required. A previous study reported that one-step nested (OSN)-qRT-PCR revealed better suitability for detecting SARS-CoV-2. However, information on the analytical performance of OSN-qRT-PCR is insufficient.",

The use of two pairs of oligonucleotides allows for a higher number of cycles to be performed, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the PCR. Feng et al.

However, the analytical performance of OSN-qRT-PCR in the published study is insufficient, lacking information such as specificity, reportable range, and the LoD.

The detectable range, consistency, specificity, and LoD of each method were comparably analyzed. Our results demonstrate that OSN-qRT-PCR and ddPCR are reliable for quantitatively detecting SARS-CoV-2. In addition, Bland-Altman analysis showed that ddPCR and OSN-qRT-PCR had good correlation with qRT-PCR in testing clinical specimens. In particular, the detection performance of both OSN-qRT-PCR and ddPCR assays were better than qRT-PCR, and the OSN-qRT-PCR assay had the lowest LoD, suggesting that OSN-qRT-PCR and ddPCR assays are valuable additions for detecting SARS-COV-2 in samples with low viral loads. Although the sensitivity of OSN-qRT-PCR was reported to be 10-fold higher than qRT-PCR using plasmids [21] , our results revealed that the sensitivity of OSN-qRT-PCR was only 2-3-fold higher than qRT-PCR when using pseudoviral RNA.",

Our findings also confirmed that although SARS-CoV-2 can colonize the upper respiratory tract, lower respiratory tract samples better reflect the viral replication level in infected patients. Although OSN-qRT-PCR and ddPCR both exhibited higher sensitivity than qRT-PCR, there were still false negative results (six missed by OSN-qRT-PCR, 11 missed by ddPCR) when analyzing clinical specimens. This may have been due to the quality of sample collection or viral loads falling below detection limits resulting from missing the optimum sample collection time. For specimen 20 # , the results of OSN-qRT-PCR and qRT-PCR were negative, while ddPCR was positive. This discordant result may have been due to the specimen type (sputum) or the various influencing factors in the nucleic acid extraction process, leading to poor stability of test results.",
