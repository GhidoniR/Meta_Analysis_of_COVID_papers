            "text": "Existing parking recommendation solutions mainly focus on finding and suggesting parking spaces based on the unoccupied options only. However, there are other factors associated with parking spaces that can influence someone's choice of parking such as fare, parking rule, walking distance to destination, travel time, likelihood to be unoccupied at a given time. More importantly, these factors may change over time and conflict with each other which makes the recommendations produced by current parking recommender systems ineffective. In this paper, we propose a novel problem called multi-objective parking recommendation. We present a solution by designing a multi-objective parking recommendation engine called MoParkeR that considers various conflicting factors together. Specifically, we utilise a non-dominated sorting technique to calculate a set of Pareto-optimal solutions, consisting of recommended tradeoff parking spots. We conduct extensive experiments using two real-world datasets to show the applicability of our multi-objective recommendation methodology.",

            "text": "Finding street parking in crowded cities is challenging and thus requires a highly functional and efficient parking management strategy. Searching for available parking can cause congestion and wasted land use. A research found that vehicles cruising for suitable parking in Los Angles were responsible for 730 tons of carbon emissions through the burning of 47,000 gallons of gasoline in one year [10] . The research also identified that the distance travelled during the search for parking was equivalent to 38 trips around the world. These problems can be minimised by providing drivers with effective recommendations about their parking choices. However, effective parking recommendation is very complex as it is influenced by various factors such as parking fare, rule, walking distance to the destination location, total travel time, and likelihood of parking locations be available at a given timestamp. Moreover, these factors can be conflicting with each other. For instance, a lowfare parking spot may require long-distance walking to destination. Additionally, some of these factors (e.g. fare, parking rules) may vary across different times of the day which makes the parking recommendation problem more complex. With the growing trends in adopting ubiquitous technologies, many cities around the world have implanted smart sensors to collect data related to parking events. Many researchers use this data to extract meaningful information. The current research mainly focuses on predictive analytics of parking events using univariate and multi-variate signals. Another research direction uses event logs from parking sensor data to make new policies (e.g. new parking rule or dynamic parking price) [9, 13] . There are a few research that provides parking recommendation based on future availability [18] . However, this group of research rarely consider user preferences as it is challenging and complex due to the presence of multiple factors. The presence of various factors in user preferences makes the existing parking recommender systems ineffective. arXiv:2106.07384v1 [cs.IR] 10 Jun 2021",

This dataset integrates parking-event feeds from in-ground as well as vision-based sensors. Both of the datasets have similar attributes to describe a particular parking event in a time-series manner. To understand the parking behavior in these two cities, we plot heatmaps of parking locations in terms of frequencies of parking events and time-usage. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate different parking patterns in these two cities. The heatmap in Figure 1 (a) shows average parking events of two-weeks between 8.30 am and 9.00 am in different parts of Melbourne CBD while Figure 1 (b) depicts a time-usage heatmap of parking locations. We can see that the parking locations with a high number of parking events are also accounted for high utilisation times. However, there are many other locations with lower parking events that turned out to be highly utilised by single parking events within the selected time window. In contrast, similar locations seemed to be highly utilised in terms of both events and time-usage in Rye as can be seen from Figures 2(a)-(b). We plot the average utilisation in the first two weeks of January 2020 between 2.00 pm and 2.30 pm. This may be due to the fact that Rye is a busy tourist spot on the coastline where these parking locations provide easy access to the beaches and shops.",

In this module, parking events data collected from sensors (i.e. in-ground and vision-based) are stored in the central storage. Since two side-by-side parking bays are of less significance in terms of their physical location, we cluster those to form parking lots. We adopted a spatial-clustering technique to form parking lots consists of multiple parking bays. Specifically, two parking bays are part of a single parking bays (i.e. cluster) if both are connected to each other, or the distance between these slots is within a specific value and they have the same parking restriction (e.g. 1 hour, 2 hours, loading zone).

The details of epsilon-domination framework are described in [3, 8] . Since there could be many elements in the Pareto front, we adopted a Crowding distance technique to achieve a smaller number of parking lots for final recommendation. The concept of crowding distance is to measure the relative isolation of a solution in the Pareto front from other solutions. The greater the crowding distance, the greater is its isolation and hence, higher chance to be included in the final recommendation. We further refine the selected solutions by applying an objective-thresholding. Specifically, we consider a threshold for an objective, e.g., for parking likelihood in our case to ensure that the solution subset only comprises of the parking spaces with high likelihood. Algorithm 1 illustrates the deployed crowding distance calculation mechanism in our study. Given a set of candidate solutions and objective-threshold , this algorithm computes crowding distance of all candidate solutions in . The computation starts by initializing all candidates to 0. Upon satisfying the objective-threshold , the candidates are sorted in ascending order in turn for each objective. Note that the first and last candidates (i.e. boundary points) from the sorted list are selected automatically as they have an only neighbor candidate in total. Hence, we assign the largest crowding distance score of \u221e. Give any objective, the crowding distance for the rest of the candidates in are calculated as follows. First, we subtract the objective value of candidate \u22121 from the objective value of candidate +1. Then the result is divided by the ( . ) \u2212 ( . ) where, ( . ) and",

These two locations are situated in inner-city Melbourne. Figure 4 shows four journeys connecting four different parking lots computed by our MoParkeR engine. These parking lots are chosen arbitrarily from the set of recommended parking lots for illustration purposes. A full list of recommended trade-off parking lots are given by Table 1 . To generate these journeys, we first applied MoParkeR to calculate a set of non-dominated (i.e., Pareto-optimal) parking lots. The computed Pareto front can have a large number of parking lots since we have four objectives to consider. To reduce the users' information burden, this number is further reduced by applying a crowding distance mechanism and objective-threshold in the computed Pareto-front before presenting the final recommendations. Upon calculation of final recommendations, the journeys can be constructed by using direction services (e.g. Google API). We can see from Figure 4 that the four recommended parking LotIDs have non-dominated objective values in terms of travel time, walk to a destination, parking fare, and parking likelihood. For instance, the LotID-172 requires a driver smallest walking to the destination (i.e. 0.4 km) with an end-to-end travel time of 14 minutes, a fare of $0.6 and a very certain likelihood of parking. On the other hand, LotID-5129 provides users with a free parking lot but costs a long walk to destination after parking the car which also causes a longer travel time. All these trade-off parking lots satisfy our recommendation refinement criteria (i.e. likelihood \u2265 0.7) for an increased chance of getting a parking spot available to park.",
