            "text": "Background: Vascular angiopathy is suggested to be the major cause of silent hypoxia among COVID-19 patients without severe parenchymal involvement. However, pulmonologists and clinicians in intensive care units become confused when they encounter acute respiratory deterioration with neither severe parenchymal lung involvement nor acute pulmonary embolism. Other radiological vascular signs might solve this confusion. This study investigated other indirect vascular angiopathy signs on CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) and involved a novel statistical analysis that was performed to determine the significance of associations between these signs and the CT opacity score of the pathological lung volume, which is calculated by an artificial intelligence system. Results: The study was conducted retrospectively, during September and October 2020, on 73 patients with critical COVID-19 who were admitted to the ICU with progressive dyspnea and low O 2 saturation on room air (PaO 2 < 93%). They included 53 males and 20 females (73%:27%), and their age ranged from 18 to 88 years (mean \u00b1 SD= 53.3 \u00b1 13.5). CT-pulmonary angiography was performed for all patients, and an artificial intelligence system was utilized to quantitatively assess the diseased lung volume. The radiological data were analyzed by three expert consultant radiologists to reach consensus. A low CT opacity score (\u226410) was found in 18 patients (24.7%), while a high CT opacity score (>10) was found in 55 patients (75.3%). Pulmonary embolism was found in 24 patients (32.9%); three of them had low CT opacity scores. Four other indirect vasculopathy CTPA signs were identified: (1) pulmonary vascular enlargement (57 patients-78.1%), (2) pulmonary hypertension (14 patients-19.2%), (3) vascular tree-in-bud pattern (10 patients-13.7%), and (4) pulmonary infarction (three patients-4.1%). There were no significant associations between these signs and the CT opacity score (0.3205-0.7551, all >0.05). Furthermore, both pulmonary vascular enlargement and the vascular tree-in-bud sign were found in patients without pulmonary embolism and low CT-severity scores (13/15-86.7% and 2/15-13.3%, respectively).",

            "text": "In particular, \"pulmonary vascular enlargement\" was the most common radiological finding. This is consistent with findings in the study by Bai et al. [11] , in which pulmonary vascular thickening or enlargement was identified in 59% of their COVID-19 patients but in only 22% of patients with other types of viral pneumonia; the difference was significant (<0.001). Li et al. [12] and Caruso et al. [13] -also found this sign in 82.4% and 89% of their patients, respectively. These results were also similar to those in the study by Lang et al. [8] in which dilated pulmonary vessels were identified in 85% of the patients: 79% were identified within the pulmonary opacities, and 56% were identified outside of lung opacities. Additionally, the dilated distal pulmonary vessels extended to the pleura in 83% of the cases. They attributed pulmonary vascular dilatation to the failure of normal hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and dysfunctional vasoregulation. This typically is a result of the diffuse inflammatory process and the consequent overactivation of the regional vasodilatation cascade. This can explain COVID-19-related silent hypoxia in patients with normal lung compliance who develop a significant ventilation/perfusion mismatch. The results of this study matched those of the study by Leonard-Lorant et al. [14] , in which acute PE was identified in 30% of the patients. This proportion was even higher than the proportion of the critically ill patients without COVID-19 (1.3%) and the proportion of emergency department patients (3-10%). \"The vascular tree-in-bud pattern\" is a newly described sign that was defined in our study as dilated branching sub-segmental pulmonary arterioles that were not obscured by dense parenchymal opacification. This was consistent with the definition used in the study by Fox et al. [15] , in which these enhanced distal pulmonary branches were assumed to be a sign of pulmonary thrombotic micro-angiopathy as supported by previous postmortem data. This pattern was identified in 13.7% of our patients, which was a much smaller proportion than Fig. 4 A 72-year-old COVID-19 male patient with pulmonary vascular enlargement (PVE) on a background of borderline total opacity score (TOS): a Coronal lung window CTPA revealed bilateral basal pulmonary vascular dilatation (more on the left side with relatively increased opacity density) manifested by abnormally increased calibre within the pulmonary abnormal opacity as well as lack of tapering and extension till the pleural surface (blue and yellow squares). Bilateral upper lobar PVE is also noted within the pulmonary abnormal ground-glass opacity (more on the left side-brown square) compared to the nearby cranial vessels in (purple square) and contralateral same level vessels in (green square). Right apical PVE outside the abnormal opacity is also noted (red square). b Detailed artificial intelligence quantitative assessment revealed: TOS = 10/20 and volumetric percentage = 37.83% the 64% reported in the study by Patel et al. [16] . Pulmonary infarctions and pulmonary hypertension were also described in our study, which was similar to the findings in the study by Lang et al. [8] There were no significant relationships identified between these vasculopathy CT signs and the CT opacity scores; therefore, the presence of pulmonary vascular enlargement and, less commonly, the vascular tree-in-bud sign can explain the deterioration in respiratory condition among those patients with a low CT opacity score and no pulmonary embolism.",
