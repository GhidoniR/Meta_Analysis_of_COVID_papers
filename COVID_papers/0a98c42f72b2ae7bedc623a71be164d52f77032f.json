Purpose: We present the structure of a nurse-led telephonic palliative program and operational metrics to influence further development of tele-palliative programs. Methods: The nurses engage with seriously ill patients for 6 months with the goal of discussing advance care planning (ACP) and addressing self-identified issues related to their illness. Findings: Of the first 100 program graduates, 78% were actively engaged and 51% named a health care agent and/or engaged in ACP. Of the 18 patients who died during the study, 13 (72%) were enrolled in hospice services. Discussion: Our preliminary results indicate that seriously ill patients are willing to engage with nurses and to participate with discussions on ACP. Conclusion: Given the gaps in health care exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, this innovative program serves as an important model for bringing palliative care directly to patients.",

Payers have taken the lead in developing telephonic programs to address the diverse needs of patients with serious illness. Aetna's Compassionate Care Program supports members with advanced illnesses via nurse case managers, which demonstrated a reduction in acute care days by 82%, a reduction in ICU care days by 86% and a decrease in emergency department (ED) use by 78% (Krakauer et al., 2014) . SCAN Health Plan's Program for Advanced Illness, a telephonic case management program carried out by nurses, has demonstrated reductions in Medicare costs while increasing hospice utilization for their members (Spettell et al., 2009; Yamarik & Mattews, 2015) . It remains unclear, however, how nurse-led telephonic care may affect quality of life, symptom burden, and caregiver distress. Additionally, patient identification, structure, and operational aspects of these programs have not been well described, making program replication challenging.",

Training is also ongoing, and a portion of every monthly team meeting is dedicated to content-specific training based on needs identified by both the nurses and supervising providers in a collaborative process.

Upon patient enrollment, the patient's primary provider and/or specialist receives a standard welcome letter describing the program and the role of the telephonic nurse.

Nurses subsequently contact providers on an ad hoc basis until the 6-month graduation from the program. In addition, for hospitalized patients, nurses reach out to inpatient providers to deliver critical information about patients' goals of care.",

Additionally, initial analyses of our results demonstrated an overall patient engagement rate of 78% and 42% engagement with ACP. Patient engagement in our program is high, likely due to the ability to overcome those challenges encountered by palliative care delivered via the traditional outpatient model such as the logistics of scheduling, the scarcity of services, and difficulties associated with travel, particularly in more rural locations (Finlay et al., 2018) . Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic brought forth new barriers, including infection control and concerns around the exposure to a vulnerable population. Palliative care delivered telephonically may overcome these challenges through ease of delivery and the ability to bring palliative care directly to the patient. In a study on advanced heart failure patients undergoing a mixed in-person and telephonic palliative care model, Bakitas et al. (2017) demonstrated that 69% of participants attended all intervention sessions (Bakitas et al., 2017) . A similar study describing a nurse-led, telephone-based palliative care intervention for newly diagnosed lung cancer patients showed an 85% retention rate through their 3-month program. Our data also demonstratesthat seriously ill patients are willing to engage in nurse-led telephonic palliative care programs and that engagement rates in our program do not differ from other telephonic interventions.",

Establishing regular contact with patients by telephone, both initially and on a weekly or biweekly basis for 6 months, is often difficult. Patients are often resistant to answering calls from numbers that are not from a trusted source, while scheduling calls for patients who are feeling ill or have numerous medical commitments is challenging. Additionally, some patients transition to skilled nursing facilities or long-term care, which can make contact more difficult. Engaging with providers is another challenge for the telephonic nurses as routes of communication vary based on institutional culture and norms. During ACP conversations, the nurses attempt to schedule a three-way telephone call with the patient and HCAs, however, this can often be challenging. When this is not possible, nurses have first engaged in an ACP conversation with the patient, followed by a separate call with the HCA to discuss and share the patient's goals and priorities of care.",
