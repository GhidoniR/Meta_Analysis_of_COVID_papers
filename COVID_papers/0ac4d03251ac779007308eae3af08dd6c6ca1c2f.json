Hospitals, institutions and regions have approached dilemmas differently, attempting as best they can to match needs of diverse patient populations in the midst of a pandemic. In their article, Extremely Premature Infants, Scarcity and the COVID-19 Pandemic, Kaempf et al 1 suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in 'obstetricians, neonatologists, and/or with decades of dialogue between researchers and bioethicists. 8 We do not contest the importance of considering costs in societal distribution of resources. However, there are no perfect comparison measures 2 and arguments can be swayed based on the studies selected. For example, using analyses of insurance costs over the first 6 months of life without value assessments, the authors conclude interventions are too costly at extremes of prematurity. However, they could have also presented favourable cost analyses of selective and universal interventions at birth for 23-week gestations followed through to adolescence. 9 In addition, resources are more often allocated towards survivors in neonatal ICUs than in adult MICUs. 8 As short-term survival guides resource allocation for COVID-19 triage protocols, 3 this information may be the most relevant.",

We disagree and urge the authors to consider perspectives, highlighted by the pandemic, which help to clarify why many obstetricians, neonatologists and ethicists remain in support of providing extremely premature infants equal consideration in allocation algorithms with other patients. 2 We believe the COVID-19 pandemic has led to greater recognition of attitudes towards the value of life with disability, 3 thereby challenging the use of health outcome descriptors such as 'suboptimal'. We will highlight how reporting on long-term disability studies is inherently susceptible to bias, and how interpretations of resource consumption based on ambiguous cost-effectiveness studies can be flawed. Lastly, we will argue that when life and death options previously considered reasonable are limited during a pandemic, shared decision-making is jeopardised.

Indeed, public outcry in the COVID-19 crisis has unequivocally confirmed that 'severe disability' should not automatically disqualify patients from access to critical life-sustaining resources. 3 How outcomes are categorised can also reflect biases. Outcomes based on physician conceptualisations may not reflect the experiences or values of parents and children. 5 For some parents, the worst outcome is death, and for others, it is severe disability; for many outcomes, it depends on how the child and the family function together within society irrespective of 'disability category'. For example, deafness, considered a 'mere difference' by the Deaf community, is a 'severe disability' in neonatal outcome studies. Moreover, health-related quality of life is not determined by disability, but rather functionality, which cannot be ascertained from simplistic disability classification, and is highly impacted by the family environment and what accommodations society designs to assist those with disabilities function optimally. Furthermore, discordance exists in quality-of-life assessments between providers, parents of disabled children and the disabled children themselves, reflecting our discipline's tendency towards 'glass-half-empty' sentiments. 6, 7 Thus, combining composite outcomes of death with severe disability 1 unjustifiably equates the value of these outcomes.",

However, understanding outcome data and their limitations, much less conveying them to parents, requires thoughtfulness and caution, as decision-making under conditions of uncertain outcome and variable value prioritisation are vulnerable to biases. Careful attention to the 'principle findings' in Kaempf et al's 1 Table compared with their sources illustrates examples of broader provider bias. For instance, the authors omit mild disabilities (30%) when reporting on the entire sample, and they combine death with moderate and severe disability in their summary of gestational weeks from Serenius et al 4 Framed another way, the authors could have reported 2 out of 3 surviving infants of extremely premature gestations have mild or no disabilities, as Serenius et al concluded.",
