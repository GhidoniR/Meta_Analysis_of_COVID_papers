            "text": "In responding to Covid-19 anatomists have succeeded in adapting their teaching to online delivery. However, long-term reliance on this mode of teaching raises the prospect that transferring the whole of the learning environment to an impersonal digital world will lead to loss of anatomy's humanistic side. In looking to a future increasingly dependent upon digital input to teaching, a number of roadblocks are identified. These are: the peril of abandoning the ethos of anatomy; for the workload of staff and especially for female academic staff; by a lack of adequate resources; to the research nature of departments, including the quality of research; to the position of anatomy in the biomedical sciences; and from pressures to retreat from a dissection-based education. In tracing a future trajectory for anatomy, issues outlined are the inevitability of change, the need for anatomy to market itself to the world, and the opportunities presented for anatomy to view itself increasingly as a contributor to broad scholastic endeavors. Suggestions include exploring the possibilities presented by virtual anatomy museums, the use of online learning to reach those not normally in touch with anatomy teaching, and exploring the integrated courses with humanities disciplines. It is concluded that anatomy will flourish if there is a willingness to expand the traditional horizons and be prepared to integrate all that is best in the personto-person and digital worlds.

Whether students are preparing for entry into a health sciences profession or for a research-driven academic career in the neurosciences, reproductive sciences, or biological anthropology, there is no escaping the actual human body and body parts--laboratory-based or clinic-based. The contrast between any of these environments and one centered on a computer screen is stark. Using the latter as an accessory to the former poses no problems, indeed it may well enhance the person-centered experience.

The aim is to emphasize that anatomists are dealing with the bodily remains of a once living person, rather than concentrating solely on the fragments of a dissected body. It is a dead person rather than an impersonal cadaver, an embodied individual rather than abstracted bodily remains. The increasing recognition of the place of commemorations and memorials following anatomical dissection is a significant move in this direction \u0160trkalj and Pather, 2017) . It is important that online teaching clings to this central insight that anatomy always brings its practitioners face-to-face with the remains of once-living fellow human beings (Jones, 2020) . The upshot of this is that virtual cadavers are always more than mere research and teaching tools. They are real bodies \"at a distance,\" but still one with us in their continuing humanity. In this sense, human anatomy teaching constantly has a \"contact\" element if it is to remain true to its ethos.",

Theoretically compelling as this may be, it has to be admitted that online teaching and learning makes it difficult to hold on to such a holistic view of the human body (Jones, 2020) . Considerable efforts are required to invest the digital with personal dimensions. The person-centered ethos of anatomy, and the notion of viewing dead bodies as the students' first patient or first teacher, are challenged to the core in a digitalonly world (Coulehan et al., 1995; Winkelmann and G\u00fcldner, 2004; Hasselblatt et al., 2018) .

How does one deal ethically with the impersonal and artificial? In assessing the place of 3D printed body parts in an ethical hierarchy, Jones (2019) proposed a hierarchical sequence from the intact body at one end to purely artificial models at the other. According to this scheme, images and computer simulations of the body/body parts lie at the artificial end of the scale, far removed from the dissected body and even plastinations. This is a salutary reminder that great care will have to be taken as anatomists move increasingly into dependence upon online learning with its images and simulations.",

This could be described as Covid-19-resilient, which sounds virtuous. However, hybrid teaching is a double burden on staff, who end up having the worst of both worlds--preparation for normal teaching and for virtual teaching. Although the burdens placed on them for lecture-style delivery may not be substantial, the same cannot be said for laboratory sessions, tutorial work, and patientbased teaching.

Reports from anatomy departments with a minimum of technical resources are beginning to come in and show how catastrophically disadvantaged many of them are, for example, Mozambique and Nigeria. Serious as this is for current teaching, it may also have repercussions in the future for graduates from these countries who wish to apply to more advantaged institutions to study for postgraduate degrees or even posts. This demonstrates that discussions about responses to the Covid-19 pandemic are incomplete if they are confined to Western countries and those with comparable ample technological, and other resources. This is not a new phenomenon for anatomists since it has been a factor in obtaining body bequests, as opposed to relying on unclaimed bodies (Jones and Whitaker, 2012; Habicht et al., 2018) . While the issues have little in common, the discrepancies across countries and cultures are strikingly similar. In light of these concerns, it would be timely if the International Federation of Associations of Anatomists (IFAA) through its constituent anatomical associations sought to provide advice on how best to establish and maintain online programs, including the provision of financial support and academic advice. This would complement the IFAA guidelines on body donation procedures during the pandemic (Kramer et al., 2020) .",

This is of significance for all anatomy departments, but of immediate consequence for those departments in which research is flourishing and well supported. Here the expectations will have been to place as much, if not more, emphasis on research than on teaching. Anatomy departments need a strong research base, so that they stand tall alongside other strong academic centers of excellence (Jones et al., 2002) . An unfortunate consequence has been that, compared with their more prestigious looking research colleagues, teachers have been regarded as poor cousins. Research grants have been welcomed and lauded, whereas those embroiled in teaching large classes, especially in the dissecting room, have been inundated with large teaching schedules and, in the absence of large research grants, have been viewed as bringing in little money.",

This is not the place to enter into the pros and cons of dissection, but there is an important point that needs to be made.

What is required is creative and innovative thinking about the most appropriate ways of presenting what is deemed the highest level of educational experience possible.

A first step could be to take short anatomy courses to tertiary level students outside the health sciences, and also to interested parties outside tertiary institutions. Integrated courses with humanities disciplines broaden the scale of courses available, and demonstrate the relevance of anatomical concepts for a general education crossing the sciences and humanities. Courses along these lines lend themselves to online modes of delivery, and illustrate the possibilities of transdisciplinary approaches in which anatomy plays a central part in throwing light onto social and cultural attitudes toward the human body within a pre-modern as well as contemporary scientific environment (Sawday, 1995) .",

In this regard, there is nothing special about the demands on anatomy, and yet its dependence upon the availability of the bodies of the deceased for dissection and other studies sets it apart, and makes it less suitable for ready translation to online learning. The main reason for this is that much of the experience of confronting the dead and learning how to cope with this within a professional context has disappeared. This is not an argument against any reliance at all upon online learning, nor against finding ways in which basic anatomical knowledge can be disseminated to those outside the professional world of anatomy, but it does seek to place it in a particular context. However, changes in attitudes and a willingness to expand traditional horizons are crucial if anatomy is to flourish and emerge as a fascinating mix of the traditional and contemporary, integrating all that is best in the person-toperson and digital worlds.
