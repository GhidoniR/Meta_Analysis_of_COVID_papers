Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of peracetic acid (PAA) dry fogging in decontaminating healthcare facility surfaces experimentally contaminated with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Nine materials (stainless steel, latex painted wood, unsealed hardwood, melamine countertop, vinyl flooring, clear plastic, faux leather, computer keyboard button, and smartphone touch screen) were surface contaminated with >10 6 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) of SARS-CoV-2, and allowed to dry before exposing to PAA dry fogging. Findings: When fumigated with PAA dry fog for 1 h, no infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus was recovered from any of the experimentally inoculated surface types. By contrast, high titres of infectious virus were recovered from corresponding untreated drying controls of the same materials. Conclusion: Standard surface decontamination processes, including sprays and wipes, are laborious and frequently cannot completely decontaminate sensitive electronic equipment. The ease of use, low cost, and overall effectiveness of a PAA dry fogging suggest that it should be considered for decontaminating healthcare settings, particularly intensive care units where severely ill SARS-CoV-2 patients are cared for.",

Unlike regular spray, the ultrafine particles of a fog fail to settle readily on surfaces and cause dampness, hence the name dry fog. The dry fog behaves like a vapour: it fills the entire space, and diffuses into all areas and surfaces to provide decontamination of the whole space and the surfaces contained within. PAA fumigation has been effective against bacterial spores and viruses, and it has been used to decontaminate subway railcar, laboratories, biosafety cabinets, and N95 respirators [33e39]. In the air, the PAA has a half-life of 22 min, followed by breakdown to water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide [40] . ",

The health of the cell monolayer of the infected flask was compared to a non-infected Vero E6 flask over the course of the incubation. On day 3e4, cytopathic effect, as defined by cell detachment and cell rounding, became evident where >90% of the cell monolayer was lifted in infected flasks. At this point, the supernatant was aspirated and pooled with a clarification step at low-speed centrifugation (4500 g) for 10 min. The clarified supernatant was overlaid on to a 20% (w/v) sucrose cushion in TriseNaCleEDTA buffer and centrifuged at 134,000 g for 2 h. The resulting viral pellet was suspended in VCM by repeat pipetting and aliquots stored in cryovials at e70 C until needed.

An air compressor (model 2807CE72; Thomas, Monroe, LA, USA) set at 40 psi supplied compressed air needed for the nozzles to generate the dry fog from the chemical mixture contained in the 19 L reservoir. The chemical mixture, Minncare Cold Sterilant (Mar Cor Purification, Skippack, PA, USA), contained 4.5% PAA, which was diluted appropriately to achieve 1.6 mL/m 3 at 80% relative humidity (RH). Initial temperature and relative humidity levels of the rooms were measured using Professional Thermo-Hygrometer (TFA Dostmann Product #30.3039) and were used to calculate the amount of chemical and deionized water needed to be mixed to attain 80% RH. The door between the rooms was left open during the fumigation; the fogger was placed in the doorway with one nozzle directed towards the small room and the other two towards the large room ( Figure 1 ). Fourteen biological indicators (Spordex, #NA333, Steris, Mentor, OH, USA) were placed at various locations within the rooms to validate room decontamination.

One recent study showed evidence of widespread contamination on surfaces in patient rooms including toilets, ventilation grills, and even on the floor under the beds without direct patient contact [6] .

Infectious agents do not deposit themselves cleanly on the surfaces; they will be in a milieu of patients' excretions/ secretions, which after drying would be a challenge for disinfecting chemicals to inactivate. In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 virus was suspended in a standard tripartite organic soil load to represent such a challenging milieu, and then dried on to the test coupons. As noted before, PAA e both in the liquid and the fumigant form e tolerates organic soil load well, which is consistent with our finding here, where all the surfaces were decontaminated upon a 1 h exposure [34, 47] . Expensive electronic equipment is plentiful in modern healthcare settings; they are a necessity to provide modern patient care. A fumigation technology selected to decontaminate such a facility and the equipment in it should not damage electronic equipment; PAA fumigation has previously been shown to be compatible with electronics after repeat exposures in a laboratory setting [34] .",

In most healthcare settings, the heatingeventilationeair conditioning system may not be equipped to exhaust a room/section easily. A variety of commercially available standalone gas scrubbers containing activated charcoal may be employed to remove residual PAA from such rooms after fumigation.

Whereas the focus of this work was decontamination of surfaces found in healthcare settings, these materials are common in a variety of structures. There have been reports of COVID-19 outbreaks in cruise ships, schools, sports facilities, and long-term care centres [14,49e52] . Thus, PAA fumigation can be used to Figure 3 . Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 on nine common healthcare facility surfaces by peracetic acid dry fogging. Surface coupons contaminated with 10 mL of virus inoculum were subjected to 1 h dry fogging cycle (N \u00bc 3 biological replicates per surface type) followed by elution in virus culture medium. No infectious virus was recovered from dry-fog-exposed coupons; viral titres recovered from the unexposed, dried positive control coupons of the same material type and quantified by end-point titration in Vero E6 cells are also shown.",
