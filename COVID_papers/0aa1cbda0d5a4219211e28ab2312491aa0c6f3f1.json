This study examined demographic, relationship, exercise, and cancer history correlates of survivors' and their romantic partners' couples-based exercise beliefs and their preferences for program designs. Methods All participants (survivors n=209, partners n=155, couples n=143) completed an online survey. Correlations and linear regression analyses were used to examine correlates of participants' importance of and interest in couples-based exercise and their likelihood of joining a couples-based exercise program. Intraclass correlations estimated shared variance at the couple level.",

Across all outcomes, partner support for exercise was most strongly associated with participants' couples-based exercise beliefs (r = 0.19-0.54, p<.05), and couples were significantly aligned in their beliefs (\u03c1=0.20-0.31, p<.01). Participants were interested in exercise programs involving exercising together (67.3%) as well as exercising separately while sharing activity data on an app or website (48.0%). Conclusions This novel understanding of couples-based exercise beliefs provides a strong foundation upon which future exercise programs may be designed for survivors and their romantic partners. Impact for Cancer Survivors Survivors' adoption and maintenance of exercise may be enhanced by the inclusion of romantic partners in exercise programs, and partners' inclusion is appealing to couples.",

            "text": "It is projected that there are over 16.9 million cancer survivors alive in the USA today, and this number is expected to increase to over 22.1 million by 2030 [1] . Despite many advances in treatments, survivors are at an increased risk for health complications including cancer recurrence, secondary cancers, and long-term side effects (e.g., pain, fatigue, sexual dysfunction) [2] . In order to prevent or ameliorate these potential adverse outcomes and improve survivorship, research has focused on the promotion of physical activity. Regular physical activity engagement is associated with reductions in cancer recurrence, cancer-specific mortality, and all-cause mortality for multiple cancer sites [3, 4] and with improvements in cancer treatment-related side effects including physiological (e.g., weight management, mobility, muscle strength), psychological (e.g., distress, self-efficacy, quality of life), and social (e.g., peer support, relationships) health outcomes [5, 6] .",

Further, researchers have failed to demonstrate sustained physical activity following exercise interventions, as intervention effects on physical activity levels are rarely maintained long term [8] . Within the realm of cancer, of the few trials that included postintervention follow-up measures, most focused exclusively on breast cancer survivors and failed to demonstrate physical activity adherence after 3 months [9, 10] . One reason physical activity interventions may not always lead to sustained effects on physical activity levels is that they rarely consider the social environment within which physical activity occurs. In response, some have suggested that new research should focus on the sustainability of physical activity participation in real-world settings by examining the influences of social and environmental factors [10, 11] .",

Indeed, romantic couples are more similar to one another in health behavior and health behavior change than are individuals in the general population [13] . Research has shown that when one partner improves his or her health behavior, the other partner is significantly more likely to make a positive health change as well [14] . Further, individual changes in exercise have been positively correlated with spousal changes, and individuals had a greater likelihood of meeting physical activity guidelines if their spouse met the recommendations [15] . Patient-caregiver exercise interdependence has also been demonstrated in cancer populations, such that increased patient exercise was associated with greater caregiver exercise [16] . Finally, for those experiencing a chronic condition (i.e., cancer), couple-focused interventions have been shown to be more effective than individual or treatment-as-usual interventions [17] .",

However, most cancer-related exercise programs thus far have been designed exclusively for cancer survivors, and interventions that have included cancer caregivers have largely focused on psychoeducation, skill development, and counseling rather than behavioral modification or exercise adoption [20, 27] . Therefore, cancer caregivers may not have adequate access to physical activity programs, or they may perceive that exercise is more important for survivors than for themselves. Despite this, preliminary evidence suggests that family caregivers not meeting physical activity recommendations are motivated to increase their physical activity [28] and are willing to participate in lifestyle programs [29] . Please note, as some romantic partners may not identify with the term caregiver later in survivorship, the current study will use the term partner rather than caregiver.",

Thus, our first objective was to examine survivors' and their partners' beliefs about the importance of couples-based exercise, their interest in a couples-based exercise program, and their likelihood of participating in such a program. Further, it is important to consider who to target for couples-based exercise programs. Therefore the current study explored four categories of correlates (sociodemographic, health history, relationship factors, current physical activity) that may be associated with survivors' and partners' couples-based exercise beliefs. These categories of correlates were identified for several reasons. First, if demographics and health history factors are deemed important, they could be easily screened using medical record data to identify people to recruit for interventions. If relationship factors and physical activity levels and abilities are associated with beliefs and interests, they could be assessed prior to an intervention's start so that researchers may offer education or skills training that improves relationship dynamics or offers customizable exercise goals, which may increase intervention efficacy. Several physical activity intervention considerations have been examined among survivors [30] [31] [32] but are novel among partners and within couples. Similarly, survivors' and partners' agreement on beliefs regarding couples-based physical activity programs is currently unknown and may impact intervention recruitment, retention, and ultimate outcomes.",

Establishing which cancer survivors and partners are interested in dyadic exercise interventions, what types of dyadic interventions they prefer, and what their perceived barriers are will provide a necessary and informative foundation upon which more tailored interventions may be successfully designed.",

However, a couples-based exercise intervention may not appeal to all couples, and the success of a couples-based program will hinge on couples' shared exercise beliefs. Thus, a necessary step proceeding intervention design is to determine whether cancer survivors and romantic partners are interested in a couples-based exercise program and elucidate demographic, relationship, exercise, and cancer factors that may be associated with couples-based exercise importance, interest, and likelihood. Further, this work lays the groundwork for future couples-based interventions by exploring possible program designs, participants' concerns, and their likelihood of working with their partner to overcome barriers. Findings from this study demonstrated that more than half of survivors and partners believed that couples-based exercise is highly important and were personally interested/very interested in a couples-based exercise program. These finding are especially noteworthy as our cut-offs were stringent (score \u2265 7 for importance, score \u2265 5 for interest) and do not include participants who indicated \"somewhat\" important or interested. Additionally, a large portion of couples (42.7%) showed member agreement, such that both members within a couple highly rated interest in a couples-based program. Thus, the idea of a couples-based exercise program was attractive to survivors and their romantic partners, but gaps remain regarding why participants had lower rating for their likelihood of joining a couples-based program. Data indicated that survivors and partners may be unaware of each other's interest in a couples-based program as both survivors' and partners' perceived lower partner interest than what they themselves actually reported. Further, survivors appeared more in doubt of their partners' interest and seemed less confident in their likelihood to overcome barriers to couples-based exercise, which likely contributed to their reduced belief that they and their partner would join a couples-based exercise program. This finding is consistent with within-couple effects as couples had lowest agreement and the greatest rates of extreme mismatch regarding perceived partner interest in a couples-based program. Future research should examine whether greater communication within couples contributes to more accurate knowledge of romantic partners' exercise beliefs and, in turn, increases survivors' and partners' perceived likelihood of joining a couples-based exercise program.",

Understanding correlates of participants' beliefs may facilitate recruitment and intervention strategies as researchers may wish to screen based on specific factors or offer skills training prior to an intervention's start. Of all the factors explored, only partner support for exercise was consistently associated with survivors' and partners' couples-based exercise importance, interest, and likelihood. Additionally, partner support for exercise was almost always the strongest correlate of survivors' and partners' beliefs, regardless of which other factors were controlled. Thus, partner support for exercise is likely a better determinant of the likelihood of couple participation in an exercise program over couples' current exercise together and their general relationship satisfaction. Partner support for exercise assessed partners' recent (in the last 3 months) exercise communication (e.g., discussed physical activity with me, asked me for ideas on how he/she can get more physically active) and efforts (e.g., helped plan activities around my activity routine, changed their schedule so we could be active together). Therefore, partner support for exercise may, in part, capture frequency of couple exercise (survivors r=0.61, p<0.01; partners r=0.52, p<0.01) and relationship functioning (survivors r=0.49, p<0.01; partners r=0.48, p<0.01) and be the single best correlate of dyadic exercise behavior. Thus, researchers may wish to increase partner support for exercise prior to an interventions' start by modifying couples' exercise communication and efforts. One dyadic manipulation that may target partner support is collaborative implementation intentions, which guide couples on forming scripted plans for health behavior engagement [41] .",

Social support has been positively associated with the adoption and maintenance of physical activity in both cancer [42] and non-cancer populations [43, 44] . However, the construct of social support within exercise interventions may include broad social levels such as family, peer, or professional support [45] , and the source of social support may influence physical activity outcomes [46] . A strength of this research was that social support was specifically defined as partner support; thus, the modified use of the family subscale from the Social Support for Exercise Scale [35] may be advantageous to dyadic researchers as it may be a more precise measure of couples-based support. Future research should further validate the use of this modified scale to assess support from romantic partners, rather than all family members.",

Although the vast majority of survivors were White, non-White survivors perceived greater partner interest in a couples-based program and reported a higher likelihood of joining a couples-based program than White survivors. Future work should re-examine this relationship in more diverse samples. Also notable, age and volume of MPVA were not significantly correlated with survivors' or partners' beliefs about couples-based exercise importance, interest, or likelihood. Further, the absence of significant relationships cannot be attributed to lack of variability on age or volume of MVPA. These findings suggest that couples-based exercise interventions may appeal to couples of all ages and activity levels and thus have large dissemination potential. Further, survivors recently diagnosed with cancer or who recently completed primary treatment were more likely to believe that couples-based exercise is important, with the latter group also endorsing a greater likelihood of joining a couples-based exercise program. Thus, while age and MVPA may not limit recruitment, researchers should aim to further understand how time since diagnosis and treatment may impact survivors' beliefs in order to target recruitment efforts, especially among survivors of different cancer types.",

When participants were presented with two ideas for couples-based programs (i.e., exercise together, exercise separately, and share activity data), survivors and partners preferred the idea of exercising together. However, when directly asked if they had a preference on program format, the two options seemed equally appealing. Thus, participants appear flexible and may be open to various types of couples-based exercise programs. On average, survivors and partners scored low on couples-based exercise concerns. Interestingly, more participants were concerned (choosing \u2265 5 on items) that their partner would not want to exercise with them (survivors 19.3%, partners 9.8%) than share their activity data (survivors 5.3%, partner 5.3%), so technology-supported programs promoting both individual-and couples-based exercise may appear more feasible to couples. This idea is further supported by time being participants' greatest perceived barrier to couples-based exercise. Perhaps the option for individual exercise that contributes to a couple's shared goal may help couples overcome time barriers while still promoting change at the couple level. Previous research has explored survivors' preferences for technology-supported physical activity interventions [32, 47, 48] , but little work has been done within couples.",

Additionally, the sample was physically active, as about half of survivors and partners met the current exercise guidelines of at least 150 min of MVPA per week. Thus, this sample may be more educated, of a higher socio-economic status, and more physically active than most survivor-partner dyads. This finding is consistent with a recent systematic review and meta-analysis on physical activity in cancer survivors; most research participants were well-educated, predominately White, and tended to already engage in some physical activity prior to enrolling in an intervention [49] .",

Further, limitations are present at the couple level. It is possible that this study attracted couples with good relationships and common interests in health behaviors and goals. Additionally, most participants were in very long relationships, cohabitating, and married; thus, the results of this study may not generalize to all couples.
