Patients conducted moderate continuous (MCT, n = 24, mean age 70.3 \u00b1 10.1 years) or high-intensity interval training (HIIT, n = 22, mean age 63.6 \u00b1 12.6 years). The intensity of training was monitored with the BORG CR10 scale (intense phases \u2265 7/10 and moderate phases \u2264 4/10 points). The primary outcome was improvement (\u0394-values) of six-minute-walk-test (6 MWT), while the secondary outcomes were improvement of vital capacity (VC max ), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ), maximal inspiratory pressure (PI max ) and functional capabilities (functional independence assessment measure, FIM/FAM and Barthel scores) after 3 weeks of training. No adverse events were observed. There was a trend towards a greater improvement of 6 MWT in HIIT than MCT (159.5 \u00b1 64.9 m vs. 120.4 \u00b1 60.4 m; p = .057), despite more days of invasive ventilation (39.6 \u00b1 16.8 days vs. 26.8 \u00b1 16.2 days; p = .009). VC max (\u03940.5l \u00b1 0.6 vs. \u03940.5l \u00b1 0.3; p = .462), FEV 1 (\u03940.2l \u00b1 0.3 vs. \u03940.3l \u00b1 0.2; p = .218) PI max (\u03940.8 \u00b1 1.1 kPa vs. \u03940.7 \u00b1 1.3pts; p = .918) and functional status (FIM/FAM: \u039429.0 \u00b1 14.8pts vs. \u039430.9 \u00b1 16.0pts; p = .707; Barthel: \u039428.9 \u00b1 16.0 pts vs. \u039425.0 \u00b1 10.5pts; p = .341) improved in HIIT and MCT. Conclusions: We demonstrate the feasibility and safety of HIIT in the early rehabilitation of ICUAWS patients. Larger trials are necessary to find adequate dosage of HIIT in ICUAWS patients.",

Although there was improvement in both groups, this effect was not maintained after 1 year or a discontinuation of training. Importantly, no significant difference in serious adverse events was observed between the groups in this high-risk population [15] . HIIT seems to be as safe as other training modalities, even in high-risk patients, and compliance may even be higher due to reduced exercise time and less monotonous workouts [16] . Moreover, recent randomised trial data suggest even lower all-cause mortality in older patients performing HIIT [17] .",

Since rehabilitation from ICUAWS has been shown to be prolonged, early recognition and initiation of physical rehabilitation measures is warranted as it may decrease its incidence and improve patients' functional status [24, 25] . A randomised trial has been launched to investigate the impact of different physiotherapeutic interventions in ICU patients (FITonICU, German Clinical Trial Register, identifier DRKS00010269) [26] . However, evidence is scarce on the timing and dosage of training in critically ill patients with ICUAWS transferred from the ICU to early rehabilitation facilities (ERF) [27] .

Insurance covers 3 weeks of ERF training in our country, including physical training on 5 days per week. During the studied period, 162 patients were admitted with 66 completing all 3 weeks of training. Twenty patients did not meet the inclusion criteria, resulting in 46 patients who were entered into the study (24 in the MCT and 22 in the HIIT groups). Group allocation was done on the day of ERF admission by shared-decision making of the attending physician and physiotherapist based on the patients' estimated physical and cognitive capabilities to perform training of varying intensities. Patients suffering from severe ICUAWS unable to increase workload at ERF admission were allocated to the MCT group, the others to the HIIT group.",

Patients' physical and cognitive eligibility for inclusion in the study were determined in a team decision among the ward's physiotherapists, nurses and physicians. Inclusion criteria were prolonged weaning (> 7 days of invasive ventilation) from the respirator, and a RASS (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale) of zero points. In order to participate, patients had to be extubated; a persistent tracheostoma, or the necessity for non-invasive ventilation were no exclusion criteria.

Exclusion criteria were acute infection and sepsis, acute heart failure, respiratory failure (defined as pH < 7.25 and CO 2 > 70 mmHg), persistent hypotension (mean arterial pressure, MAP < 65 mmHg) with a need for iv treatment with inotropic drugs, refractory hypertension (defined as a systolic blood pressure > 150 mmHg despite triple antihypertensive therapy), known uncontrolled endocrinological diseases and a neurological impairment too severe to take part in testing and training, defined as a mRS of more than three points.",

We retrospectively analysed training protocols that have been established in our ERF in patients with ICUAWS after long-term invasive ventilation over 3 weeks (15 days of exercise). Both groups increased their 6 MWT tremendously after 3 weeks, starting from very low values, with a trend towards better results in the HIIT group.

We cannot claim that HIIT is superior to MCT in our population, because our study was under-powered to show such a difference (to detect a difference of 40 m in 6 MWT, a sample size of at least 40 patients per group would be necessary to achieve a power of 80%) (supplement 1). There is evidence that the duration of invasive ventilation is associated with the development of ICUAWS [41] and reduced long-term exercise performance [42] . In our study, all patients suffered from ICUAWS, but we did not find a significant association between the duration of invasive ventilation and improvement of 6 MWT. 6 MWT by itself is a predictor of survival in critically ill patients [43] . Due to our group allocation, patients with severe ICUAWS were more likely to receive MCT and tended to improve less than HIIT patients in terms of 6 MWT. We found that there were significantly more hypertensives (although low in number) and diabetics in the HIIT group, as well as more previously documented chronic heart failure cases. However, NTproBNP as a marker of heart failure was increased in both groups, which may be due to an ICU-acquired cardiomyopathy syndrome. Taken together, our data may cautiously suggest that severity of ICUAWS could be a predictor of poorer improvement of 6 MWT. A meticulous search for the presence and severity of ICUAWS on the ICU or ERF seems to be of paramount importance.",

It might be more important to regularly engage in PA (of any intensity) under supervision of experienced personnel to improve CRF. Although no significant between-group differences were detected in the secondary outcome, functional scores (Barthel and FIM/FAM), lung function testing and inspiratory muscle force markedly increased in HIIT and MCT after 3 weeks. This goes along with studies showing a beneficial effect of early and short-term ICU rehabilitation on inspiratory muscle capacity, lung function and functionality [21, 44, 45] , both after cardiological [46] [47] [48] and pneumological [49, 50] events. However, a Cochrane review has pointed out that insufficient data exists on the long-term benefits of early rehabilitation in ICUAWS and the correct dosing of interventions is widely unknown [2, 45] . To date, no evidence of a survival benefit of early rehabilitation has been found in ICU patients. However, the heterogeneity of study protocols and patients' history hampers generalisability: larger trials of early rehabilitation in ICUAWS patients have focused on the ICU setting (rather than specialised ERFs) with shorter times of invasive ventilation [51, 52] . Denehy et al. did not find a difference in 6 MWT in the intervention group after 12 months of follow-up after an ICU, ward-based and outpatient training [51] . However, this does not justify the assumption that there is no long-term effect of training in these high-risk patients; rather, there is a strong need for more trials analysing dosage and intensity of training, spanning ICU, ERF and outpatient care.",

            "text": "Similar to the SMARTEX heart failure study [15] , in which many HIIT patients exercised below the prescribed intensity of > 90% of HR peak (51%) and approximately 80% of MCT patients tended to work harder than prescribed, our HIIT group exercised at approximately 65-70% of HR max on average if one uses the widely used formula 210mean age in the HIIT group (63.6 years). This is low considering other studies which also required mean exercise heart rate to be > 90% of HR peak [17, 53] . However, it has to be noted that prescribing intensity at fixed % HR peak may lead to considerable interindividual differences due to individual heart rate performance curves [54] [55] [56] . This may even become more of a problem in our ICUAWS groups with a relevant number (and different dosing) of beta-blockers, amiodarone or digitalis, which may further increase these differences. Additionally, chronotropic incompetence independent of drug effects may play a role in our population. In our study, maintenance of exercise intensity was ensured by our physiotherapists, who accompanied every workout. However, mean P peak was even lower in HIIT compared to MCT, which indicates that workload may not have been higher in the HIIT group. Heart rate as a means to guide exercise intensity, does not pay tribute to the metabolic demands of the muscle, which can only be expressed by measurement of lactate and calculation of lactate turn points in an incremental exercise test [54] . Tschakert and Hofmann have developed an elegant equation to calculate mean workload during HIIT by integrating peak and recovery workload as well as peak and recovery duration [34] . We would encourage future prospective studies on ICUAWS to use this equation following an incremental exercise test (preferably spiroergometry) to achieve comparable workloads among patients undergoing HIIT. Spiroergometry can be seen as a prerequisite to assess HR peak and prescribe exercise intensities based on heart rate. The application of HR as a measure of intensity may also depend on the chosen HIIT protocol and may be problematic especially in protocols with short exercise phases. Furthermore, a reduction of bradycardic medication (as patients' health improve) during the recovery process in ICUAWS patients may alter HR training corridors. Repetitive lactate measurements to depict the metabolic demands of ICUAWS patients may be more reliable to steer exercise intensity than HR itself.",

This is supported by the increasing data on the safety of HIIT [16, [57] [58] [59] , even suggesting a reduced mortality in older patients compared to MCT [17] . Different workload durations ranging from 20 s to 4 min seem to be equally safe [15, 53, 60] . A recent meta-analysis found one major cardiovascular event in 17.000 HIIT training hours, which mainly occurred in the run-in phase [16] . For this reason, we chose to use a conservative run-in phase with a short duration of high-intensity workload during the first week in the HIIT group. As an exercise prescription for future studies on ICUAWS patients, we would recommend short bouts of higher intensity (< 1 min) to account for the underlying myopathy and higher metabolic challenges in these patients.",

            "text": "Our study has certain limitations. First, the BORG CR10 scale is a semi-quantitative yet validated method to measure workload [32] ; however, objective criteria to measure intensity can only be applied by baseline exercise testing, which was not feasible directly after ICU discharge. Second, our population was heterogeneous in terms of baseline diseases (hypertension, diabetes and heart failure were more prominent in the HIIT group) and, as a retrospective study, was not stratified for diagnoses and medical treatments (best medical practice was applied in both groups). Third, our training protocol was arbitrary and illustrates a necessary compromise between training science to ensure maximal improvement in CRF and patient safety. Fourth, the significant increase of HR mean and HR max over time in both groups may be attributed to an increase in workload, indicating that intensity had also increased in the MCT group, a methodological problem which has also been observed in other studies [15, 17] . Also, mean P peak did not differ between the groups, which may be due to the fact that the HIIT group was more severely impaired than the MCT group (more heart failure patients and longer periods of invasive ventilation), but may also indicate moderate rather than high-intensity interval training. Fifth, the training period was short and limited by the duration of insurance coverage of costs. Therefore, we cannot clearly differentiate the 'natural recovery' from actual training effects (a control group without bicycle ergometry would have been unethical in this phase of recovery). Spiroergometry with threshold determination and/or lactate measurements would have helped. Sixth, we did not have echocardiographic follow-up data available at the end of the study. Seventh, group allocation was done by shared decision making on the anticipated capabilities of patients, which led to a selection bias of clinically severe ICUAWS to the MCT rather than the HIIT group. Eighth, the diagnosis of ICUAWS by itself is difficult and was mainly dependent on the clinical diagnosis of an experienced neurologist. The history of a stroke itself was no exclusion criterion for the study, although an mRS of more than three points was deemed too much of a neurological impairment to take part in the study and was used as an exclusion criterion. However, we cannot entirely exclude a selection bias due to a different neurological status in the two groups as a result of the stroke (and not caused by the prolonged ventilation itself). Finally, both groups received the same amount of proprioceptive and strength training. However, a different physiological response in the HIIT and MCT group cannot be entirely excluded. ",

HIIT patients displayed more days of invasive mechanical ventilation but still there was a trend towards greater 6 MWT improvements than in the MCT group after a training period of 3 weeks. Patients in both HIIT and MCT groups improved lung function, maximal inspiratory pressure and functional status after three weeks of structured ERF training. Intensity should be increased in the HIIT group to really implement high-intensity training. Prospective, randomised, multi-centre studies with sufficient power will be necessary to properly investigate whether HIIT is superior to MCT in ICUAWS patients: HIIT should be done following incremental (spiroergometric) exercise testing and determination of thresholds. Exercise prescription should be based on the formula by Tschakert and Hofmann to ensure workload consistency [34] , aiming at high-intensity intervals (we would recommend 80-85%HR max ) of less than 1-min duration to minimise muscular lactate accumulation. A run-in phase should be obligatory to ensure patients' safety. Longer in-and out-of-hospital follow-ups will be necessary to investigate mortality in MCT and HIIT in ICUAWS patients.",
