Within three months, the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared the COVID-19 pandemic [1, 2] . Published literature on the two prior novel corona viruses, middle-east respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 1 (SARS-CoV-1), suggested that respiratory transmission contributed to dissemination of the disease, resulting in clustered outbreaks in healthcare settings and concern for potential airborne component [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Previous studies demonstrated that viral particles less than 5 \u03bcm are most likely to possess airborne capacity, permitting the virus to remain suspended in the air for more than an hour [8, 9] . These findings, and the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 observed by infection control experts, helped guide the current disease prevention recommendations by organizations such as ",

Chia et al. detected frequent contamination on surfaces surrounding the patient's bed. In addition, they acquired positive air samples, with particles >4 \u03bcm and 1-4 \u03bcm, contributing to the concern for airborne transmission [12] . Our institution is home to the Nebraska Biocontainment Unit (NBU) and a National Quarantine Unit (NQU). Our health care workers (HCW) provided care to 13 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, who were evacuated off the Diamond Princess cruise ship in March of 2020. In a recent publication, investigators from our institution reported results of surface and air samples from these isolation units, revealing an overall RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate of 72.4%. Specifically, they reported 63.2% positive RT-PCR air sample rate within patients' rooms and 58.3% in the adjacent hallways [2] . These combined findings suggest the need to develop and implement detailed protocols to prevent the local spread of this disease, specifically within emergency departments (ED) and inpatient units. To our knowledge, there has been very little published literature on the implementation of SARS-CoV-2 ED preventive protocols and their effect in preventing environmental contamination and suppressing dissemination of this disease.",

Our main ED consists of 48 rooms with an additional 4 closed rooms and 4 open patient care areas in a separate low acuity area. The designated COVID-19 cohort area (hot zone) is a pod containing 8 rooms, with an entry and exit point on opposite ends (See Fig. 1 ). Each end had closeable doors, allowing the capability to seal this area off from the rest of ED. The pod itself consisted of an open hallway splitting the 8 rooms to 4 on each side, and a three computer work station near the designated entry point. Each of the rooms had closable doors and none of the rooms had negative airflow capabilities. We designated a single entry (PPE donning area) and exit (PPE doffing area). Prior to entering the hot zone, the HCW would perform proper hand hygiene, then apply an N-95 respiratory mask and a face shield. Once within the pod, HCW would perform additional donning and doffing measures upon entering and leaving a patient room. Specifically, during the doffing process, the outside of the face shield was cleaned with a germicidal wipe, allowing the mask and shield to remain on at all times (See Fig. 2 ). HCW could remain in the hot zone for 4 h continuing this practice with the same mask and face shield. The final doffing area after leaving the hot zone, was another separated and enclosed space (Fig. 1) . The face shield was again cleaned and at that time the N-95 mask was disposed into a designated \"dirty\" bag. The HCW would then apply a surgical mask and re-enter the main ED. All ED HCW were trained on this process, which included nurses, technicians, physicians, pharmacists, and respiratory therapists. Of note, only known COVID positive or highly suspicious individuals were placed in this area, and all of our patients were required to wear a surgical mask. In addition, each room was thoroughly cleaned with germicidal wipes in between patients, as well as the hallway and workstation within the hot zone.",

This time period was at the peak of our initial COVID-19 surge and on the day of sample collection, the ED was operating at full capacity. Total ED monthly volumes were lower during our peak COVID time, and rooms/areas were staffed based on anticipated patient volumes. The hot zone was open for approximately 16 h each day. During offhours, patients presenting with symptoms highly suspicious for COVID-19 were placed in one of the 4 individual negative airflow rooms (which were located in different areas of the ED limiting our ability to create a negative airflow unit). If those were occupied then a nonnegative airflow room was utilized. Sampling was conducted over the course of our peak ED capacity for the day. During the 4-h collection timeframe, we placed eight patients in the hot zone, six of them tested positive for COVID-19. From midnight to midnight on the 14th of May, 7 out of 31 patients tested positive for COVID-19 outside of the hot zone. Prior to opening the cohort area, there had not been any patients present for at least 8 h and the entire zone had been cleaned. In addition, there was no patient flow traffic near the hot zone doors except for those patients entering and exiting. Nursing and tech staff in the hot zone were designated for 4 h shifts. During the hot zone sampling timeframe, 10 HCW would have entered and left the hot zone sampling area. Of note, no individuals outside of the investigators were aware that a sampling process was being conducted that day.",

Four stationary air samples were collected, one within the hot zone and the others in the main ED (Fig. 1) . We utilized a Sartorius Airport MD8 air sampler operating at 30 l per minutes for 30 min onto an 80 mm gelatin filter. RNA was then extracted and analyzed for the presence of the E gene of SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR, following the methods described in Santarpia et al. [2] ",

We are not negating these reports or suggestions, but rather suggesting that other strictly followed protocols adequately prevented the spread of this virus within confined spaces in our ED. The measures implemented to mitigate viral contamination of the hot zone area included patient masking, HCW PPE and donning and doffing protocols with hand hygiene, but lacked sophisticated engineering measures such as negative airflow or pressure differences between the cohort area and the main ED, and relied only on private patient rooms with closed doors. These measures to mitigate contamination of the hot zone proved effective. A recent publication demonstrated the efficacy of preventing respiratory virus shedding with forced exhalation, in patients infected with human (seasonal) coronavirus [14] . The detection of virus in the air of the hot zone demonstrates that patient masking is insufficient to prevent environmental contamination, but the low viral ppm in our sampling suggests that this practice may reduce the amount of virus that may then contaminate surfaces or infect HCWs. Any presence of viral particles in the air reaffirms the use of N-95 respirators and eye protection in the care of known COVID-19 patients or highly suspicious individuals. The total lack of hard surface contamination proves the effectiveness of surface disinfection following COVID-19 patient care without dwell time following disinfection of the room.",

We adopted a similar process for the protocol described in our methods, and our sampling results suggest that it is very effective.

We attempted to cohort 100% of patients in the hot zone areas. Invariably, we had COVID positive patients located in several other rooms in the emergency department. Similar PPE protocols and room cleaning procedures were followed in those scenarios. The lack of surface contamination outside the hot zone would support those measures. Second, we conducted our environmental sampling over a single 4-h period on one day during the peak of our initial COVID surge. Similar results acquired from sampling over different periods and across multiple days, would strengthen our findings. Finally, this protocol was implemented and tested at a single academic ED.
