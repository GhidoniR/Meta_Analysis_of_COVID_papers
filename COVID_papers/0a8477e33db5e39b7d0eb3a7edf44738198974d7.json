            "text": "S evere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) led to a global pandemic in the human population within months after its fi rst reporting (1) . Potential wildlife reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 remain unknown; susceptibility of various animal species has been described (2, 3) . Among rodent species, the Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) (4) both Cricetidae species, have proved to be highly susceptible. These rodents transmit SARS-CoV-2 to cohoused contact animals and therefore are likely to develop effective infection chains, which could result in independent SARS-CoV-2 transmission cycles in nature and sequential reintroduction to the human population (4; B.D. Griffi n et al., unpub. data, https://doi. org/10.1101/2020.07.25.221291). In Europe, bank voles (Myodes glareolus) are a widespread Cricetidae species (5) . We aimed to characterize SARS-CoV-2 infection in bank voles and their ability to maintain sustainable infection chains.",

However, isolation from samples with Cq >28 failed, in line with findings of other groups (3, 7) . Overall, bank voles proved to be susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 but did not transmit the virus to co-housed direct contact animals (initial d:r 3:1), in contrast to highly susceptible hamsters or deer mice, which transmit SARS-CoV-2 to each contact animal (d:r 1:1) within 5 days (4; B.D. Griffin et al., unpub. data, https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.25.221291). Our results suggest a tissue tropism for SARS-CoV-2 replication in bank voles to the upper respiratory tract, as seen for other species, such as ferrets, fruit bats, and raccoon dogs (3, 7) . The persistence of viral genome for at least 3 weeks in nasal tissue of directly inoculated animals was unexpected, especially because the last positive sample was retrieved 4 dpi from the respective bank voles (Table). This finding is most likely the result of the suspect- Deer mice also seem to shed virus through the rectum. However, in bank voles, the SARS-CoV-2 genome could not be detected in the intestines. Although rectal swabs and fecal samples were qRT-PCR positive, the detected Cq values were high, indicating low viral RNA levels. Therefore, the detected viral RNA likely represents residues, which might have resulted from extensive grooming behavior and therefore do not correspond with actual virus shedding from the rectum or feces. This study proves a general susceptibility of bank voles toward SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, bank voles did not transmit SARS-CoV-2 to contact animals, making them unlikely to maintain sustainable infection chains in nature. Therefore, the risk of bank voles becoming a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 in nature (for example, after contact with infected cats) is low.",
