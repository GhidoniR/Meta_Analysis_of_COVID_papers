            "text": "Annona muricata (L.), commonly called Soursop (English) or Lakshmanaphala (Kannada), is a tropical plant known for its wide range of applications in ethnomedicinal practices (Moghadamtousi et al., 2015; Gavamukulya et al., 2017; Prasad et al., 2019) . Belonging to the Annonaceae family, A. muricata has grabbed the attention of global scientific communities toward investigating the medicinal significance of its constituent phytochemicals. Found exclusive to the Annonaceae family, the annonaceous Acetogenins are one class of phytochemicals that have been investigated thoroughly for their potent biomedical properties. Chemically, Acetogenins are the metabolic derivatives of long-chain fatty acids derived via the polyketide pathway (Prasad et al., 2019) . Over 500 Acetogenins have been reported across the family (Moghadamtousi et al., 2015; Liaw et al., 2016) . Acetogenins have been reported to show significant antiviral activities against herpes simplex virus -I (HSV-I) (Padma et al., 1998) , herpes simplex virus -II (HSV-II) (Betancur-Galvis et al., 1999) , human papillomavirus (HPV) (Donne et al., 2017) , hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Apriyanto et al., 2018) , dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) (Wahab et al., 2018) , human immunodeficiency virus -I (HIV-I) (van de Venter et al., 2014; Gavamukulya et al., 2017) . The above observations confirm the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of A. muricata phytochemicals, which may also be responsible for the other biomedical properties. In this first combination of theoretical and computational studies on annonaceous Acetogenins, we have created a library of Annomuricin A, Annomuricin B, Annomuricin C, Muricatocin C, Muricatacin, cis-Annonacin, Annonacin-10-one, cis-Goniothalamicin, Arianacin and Javoricin, to investigate their in silico anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. The above compounds are unique to A. muricata and are the only reported Acetogenins with potent antibreast cancer activity. This study provides evidence for drug development exercises toward mitigation of the current pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",

Gupta et al. reported similar ADME properties apart from the 'Lipsinki Rule of 5\u2032 for phytochemicals Belachinal, Macaflavanone E and Vibsanol B, all of which interacted mainly with the VAL25 and PHE26 aminThuso acids to facilitate the binding to SARS-CoV-2 E protein Gupta et al. (2020) . In an alternative approach, Sarma et al. suggested the targeting of coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein RNA-binding Nterminal domain (NTD). In this study, Two suitable binders, one theophylline derivative and one 3,4dihydropyrimidone class molecule, were identified to target the 2OFZ, an ultrahigh resolution crystal structure of RNA binding domain of CoV N protein of resolution 1.1 \u00c5 in monoclinic form Sarma et al. (2020) . Meanwhile, another study focused on understanding the interaction of FDA approved drugs such as remdesivir, saquinavir and duranavir, as potent chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro ) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in an attempt to provide for drug repurposing and expediting the drug discovery process (Khan et al., 2020b) . Similarly, 3CL pro as well as 2\u2032-Oribosemethyltransferase (2\u2032-O-MTase) were reported druggable targets by Khan et al. for systematic drug repurposing of paritaprevir and raltegravir for 3CL pro and dolutegravir and bictegravir for 2\u2032-O-MTase (Khan et al., 2020a) . The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein has been extensively reviewed as a potential target for COVID-19 therapeutics (Basit et al., 2020) . The above findings laid the foundation for the current study. Other studies on the efficacy of phytochemicals against SARS-CoV-2 have been conducted for instance, Gupta et al. (2020) have analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) protein binding and inhibition efficiency of the plant-derived Belachinal, Macaflavanone E and Vibsanol B Gupta et al. (2020) .",
