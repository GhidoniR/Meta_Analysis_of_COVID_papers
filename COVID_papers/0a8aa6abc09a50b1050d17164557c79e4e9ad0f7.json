            "text": "The prevalence of AV among adolescents ranges from approximately 40% to 90%, increasingly affecting adults as well, whereas women are more frequently affected than men. [3] Of the 1119 participants, there were 798 females (71.31%) and 321 (28.69%) males. The participant age range was 11 to 69 years; the age was 28.32 \u00b1 7.96 years, and the characteristics of AV patients in different age groups are shown in Supplementary Table 1, http://links. lww.com/CM9/A471. AV lesions typically appear on the face, which then have a negative impact on patients' self-esteem, mood, and quality of life. [4] In this study, we observed that AV exhibited negative effects on patients' appearance ( We categorized skin types of AV patients into five groups including oily (417, 37.27%), combination (497, 44.41%), neutral (115, 10.28%), dry (45, 4.02%), and sensitive (42, 4.02%). Previous studies have shown a highly significant association between skin types and AV; [3] we also found that there was a significant association between skin type and grade of severity in AV patients (P = 0.04; Supplementary Table 2, http://links. lww.com/CM9/A471). There were 59.16% (662) patients who thought skin care products could improve AV, and 71.85% (804) patients who thought dermocosmetics could improve the clinical manifestation of AV. During the course of AV, patients used cleansers (849, 75.87%) and moisturizers (598, 53.44%) to improve AV, but only 286 (25.56%) participants used sunscreen products, and 104 (9.29%) participants did not use any products. In addition, there was no significant association between the grade of severity in AV patients and cosmetics application (P > 0.05; Supplementary (197, 17.61%) . These findings suggest that new social media would be an option for healthcare providers to distribute AV-related knowledge and care skills.",
