To this aim, we herein lay down the main pillars that should support the infrastructure of the future technology-enhanced simulation.",

By virtue of it, the trainee can improve their technical and non-technical skills through the interaction with other learners and the privilege of making mistakes safely, with corrective feedback from the simulator itself or their mentor [2] . Particularly in pediatrics, simulation has emerged as a powerful tool to enhance 360-degree medical education and has become part of pediatric residency and fellowship training programs [3, 4] . Furthermore, it may represent a method to boost skills even in other more experienced professionals (e.g. neonatologists) [5] or strengthen provider performance throughout real-time consultations with experienced clinicians while handling simulated resuscitation scenarios, using tele-medicine [6] . Nevertheless, considering at least procedural skills and teamwork behaviors, SBME usually requires strictly interactive and face-to-face educational sessions.",

This could be the case of Augmented Reality (AR) systems, such as Microsoft HoloLens, Oculus devices or Google Glass. From this standpoint, their use could enable procedural skills teaching as if both mentor and trainee were in the same location, even if they work remotely. As an example, these devices could be used to capture the learner's firstperson view of a simulated emergency/delivery room through mixed reality capture, while the mentor's hand gestures are captured through motion tracking (such as Leap Motion) and virtually displayed in the trainee's AR space. These may represent valid solutions to exploit communication through visual channel.",

Touch is one of the most ancestral senses in Nature, which typically requires lower cognitive efforts as compared to audio/visual feedback. Because of this peculiarity, the use of tactile communication may introduce considerable benefits. Roboticists have proposed many solutions to convey a number of different stimuli, such as vibrations, normal and tangential forces, temperature. Many pilot studies investigated the use of this kind of stimuli in medical settings [10] . As an example, vibration-based feedback seems very effective in conveying directional cues, which may be used to naturally guide the arm of the trainee toward given targets. Force stimuli, e.g. through an engineered fabric band which squeezes the arm of the operator, could be used to codify \"alert\" signals. The very same technology, redesigned to fit at fingertip level, may be controlled to replicate pulsations, which for example could simulate the perception of arterial beats during palpation. Voice coils motors, finally, seem very effective in reproducing the contact with a surface, its roughness, and potentially its temperature with the addition of thermal displays. It would be fascinating to investigate this line of research, especially considering that haptic technologies may be integrated in existing AR/VR settings, opening highways of potential applications in SBME.",
