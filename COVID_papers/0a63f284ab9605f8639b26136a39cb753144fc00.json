These organizations around the world exist to address unmet needs for patients and caregivers they serve. The direct impact of the pandemic on these organizations constitutes significant collateral damage. In order to better understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on brain tumor organizations, the International Brain Tumour Alliance (IBTA) carried out an international survey to identify organizational changes induced by the virus and approaches adopted to address challenges. Methods. A 37-question online survey consisting of categorical and qualitative questions was developed and circulated to 130 brain tumor organizations across the world. Seventy-seven organizations from 22 countries completed the survey (59% return rate). Descriptive statistics and content analysis were used to present the results. Results. Responses fell into the following 3 categories: (1) organizational characteristics, (2) impact of COVID-19 on services, and (3) COVID-19 impact on financial and human resources within organizations. Although organizational characteristics varied, common concerns reported were activity disruption which impacted organizations' abilities to offer usual services and challenges to sustaining funding. Both financial and human resources were stressed, but integral adaptations were made by organizations to preserve resources during the pandemic. Conclusions. Although brain tumor organizations have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, organizations quickly adjusted to this unprecedented global healthcare crisis. Nimble reactions and flexibility have been vital to organization sustainability. Innovative approaches are required to ensure organizations remain viable so that needs of brain tumor community at large are met.",

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, the classical symptoms of which include a self-limiting cough, fever, fatigue, and loss of smell or taste. Many of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 apparently experience few or no ill effects, while others experience life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome. On March 11, 2020, the coronavirus was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). 1 As of September 10, 2020, there have been more than 27 million cases of COVID-19 confirmed worldwide and nearly 900,000 deaths. 2 Much has been written about the effects that COVID-19 has had on global healthcare systems, economies, and populations. [3] [4] [5] Between January and May 2020, it was been estimated that greater than 23,000 scientific COVID-19 papers were published, with the number doubling every 20 days. 6 However, the indirect and long-lasting impact of the pandemic is yet to be realized.",

Innovation is the key to successful transitions. Organizations found new ways to advocate, fundraise, and maintain online support and presence for the brain tumor community. Many organizations plan to preserve these new approaches in the future as they have found them to be practical and successful solutions to some of the challenges caused by the pandemic. Assessing acceptability and effectiveness and addressing challenges as they arise have been reported as key measures to promoting preservation of these new approaches in adapting to a new reality, and should be part of any planned approach moving forward. 10 Results of this survey of not-for-profit and charitable organizations that support the brain tumor community are strikingly similar to those found in another survey of organizations that support the community with various types of cancer. 13 Common findings included funding issues, concerns about meeting patient needs and isolation from constituents.",

However, lockdown was not a cure for COVID-19. With the loosening of lockdowns in a number of countries, and with the continuing threat of virus spikes and second waves, everyone must still be on their guard and remain very careful. This need for continuing vigilance has given rise to a range of even more complex questions that brain tumor not-for-profits and charities are now facing. For example, how, when, and to what extent are these organizations able to resume holding events for fundraising or face-to-face meetings? Until there is a genuine method of avoiding COVID-19 or treating it successfully, what is an acceptable degree of risk for patient organizations working with a highly vulnerable brain tumor population? This is one of the reasons that the IBTA is recommending a follow-up survey to further investigate and understand the continuing COVID-19 situation as it pertains to brain tumor patient organizations. Such a survey could enquire about the status of these organizations and provide information about how they are continuing to cope and adjust to the many challenges which COVID-19 will undoubtedly continue to create as the pandemic evolves. In a follow-up survey, and with the benefit of hindsight, it would also be interesting to know how these organizations would have navigated the first months of the pandemic differently.",

It is crucial that we in the international brain tumor community take heed now of the lessons learned about how to react to a sudden and traumatic world event that upends current practices and threatens society as a whole. Such a mitigation strategy should be planned in concert with the international brain tumor patient organization community, also focusing on issues raised in the IBTA's first COVID-19 survey about the effects of the virus on brain tumor patients and caregivers. 6 Such a mitigation strategy could also include an analysis of efforts that focus on promoting sustainability and leveraging technology in times of crisis. The aim of such a strategy would be to minimize disruption to brain tumor patients and caregivers; help rapidly adjust the management of these patients in terms of treatment and support; reduce fear and create confidence in the brain tumor community; and ensure that no patient becomes an unintentional victim of a pandemic when they are already battling a brain tumor.",

Once the dust settles on this turbulent and challenging time for everyone, it will be vital to ensure-should there be another worldwide crisis-that we are prepared. The challenges of brain tumors and the devastation they cause to patients and their families do not stop, even during a pandemic. Therefore, support services and information provision; raising funds for vital research into the causes of and treatments for brain tumors; raising awareness and focusing on policy work in our communities cannot stop either. We must also ensure-should there be future pandemics or world crises-that brain tumor patient organizations have a plan to not only survive these crises but continue to thrive through them and beyond, for the sake of the communities, they serve around the world.",
