            "text": "COVID-19 is caused by a newly identified coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and has become a pandemic around the world. The illustration of the immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed for understanding the pathogenesis of the disease and its vaccine development. CD8+ T cells are critical for virus clearance and induce long lasting protection in the host. Here we identified specific HLA-A2 restricted T cell epitopes in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Seven epitope peptides 2, 6, 7, 11, 13, 14) were confirmed to bind with HLA-A2 and potentially be presented by antigen presenting cells to induce host immune responses. Tetramers containing these peptides could interact with specific CD8+ T cells from convalescent COVID-19 patients, and one dominant epitope (n-Sp1) was defined. In addition, these epitopes could activate and generate epitope-specific T cells in vitro, and those activated T cells showed cytotoxicity to target cells. Meanwhile, all these epitopes exhibited high frequency of variations. Among them, n-Sp1 epitope variation 5L>F significantly decreased the proportion of specific T cell activation; n-Sp1 epitope 8L>V variant showed significantly reduced binding to HLA-A2 and decreased the proportion of n-Sp1-specific CD8+ T cell, which potentially contributes to the immune escape of SAR-CoV-2.",

Thus, the identification of epitopes specific to SARS-CoV-2 and illustration of the corresponding T cell responses are of great relevance to the understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis and vaccine development. Computational analysis has been carried out to predict potential T cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 (9) , and T cell responses specific to SARS-CoV-2 have also been tested in convalescent COVID-19 patients by using predicted peptide 'megapools' (8) . Recently, multiple specific CD8+ T cell epitopes have been identified throughout SARS-CoV-2 ORFs including spike protein (10) . These epitopes were widely shared among SARS-CoV-2 isolates and located in regions of the virus that are not subject to mutational variation. Therefore, the above epitope identification is beneficial to the development of With the continuous epidemics worldwide, variations in virus strains have been found in many countries. It's reported recently that CD8+ T cell epitope variants in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein led to persistently variable SARS-CoV-2 infection with different susceptibility and severity (11) . In view of the above phenomenon, we analyzed the epitope variations of the spike protein among SARS-CoV-2 strains from different geographic regions and evaluated the epitope characteristics of these variations.",

The sequences of all the potential peptides were compared with Clustal Omega and 15 candidate peptides specific to SARS-CoV-2 were selected (Table 1 and Table S1 ). To validate these predicted epitopes, we first checked whether they could be presented by HLA-A2 on the antigen presenting cells (APC). T2A2 is an APC with TAP deficiency, whose peptide-MHC complex would be more stabilized if the epitopes bind suitably ( Figure S1A ). Comparing to the well-known CD8+ T cell epitope GIL (GILGFVFTL) from influenza A virus (IAV), most of the predicted SARS-CoV-2 epitopes showed reasonable HLA-A2 binding ( Figure 1A&B ). We further checked the direct binding of these epitopes to recombinant HLA-A2 molecules. In the UV exchange peptide-MHC assay, peptides n-Sp1, n-Sp2, n-Sp9 and n-Sp10 exhibited strong binding to HLA-A2, similar to IAV epitope GIL. However, n-Sp5 and s-Sp12 could not bind to HLA-A2, while the remaining peptides showed moderate binding capability ( Figure 1C ).",

The lysate was collected into chitin resin balanced with Column Buffer (20mM Tris-HCl pH8.5, 0.5M NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.05%Tween20) at a low flow rate (0.5mL/min). After 15 column volume washing, on-column cleavage was conducted by quickly washing the column with 3 column volumes of the Cleavage Buffer (Column Buffer supplemented with 50 mM DTT). The column was incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 36 hours and the target protein was eluted using 3 column volumes of Column Buffer. Purified heavy chain portion was incubated with 50mM biotin (Thermo Fisher, Cat#B20656) at 4-8 \u00b0C overnight for biotinylation. Samples of every step were collected for SDS-PAGE analysis.Preparation of Peptide-HLA-A2 monomer UV-sensitive peptide-HLA-A2 monomer was refolded in refolding buffer (100mM Tris-Cl pH 8.3, 5M urea, 0.4M arginine HCl, 3.7mM cysteamine, 6.3mM cysteamine, and 2mM EDTA) at 4 \u00b0C. In brief, 500\u00b5L of 20mM UV-sensitive peptide VPLRPM'J'Y (J represents Fmoc-(S)-3-amino-3-(2-nitrophenyl) propionic acid) and 30 mg of \u03b22-Microglobulin were added to the refolding mixture via syringe. Next, 10 mg HLA-A2 heavy chain protein was added to the refolding mixture via syringe every 8 hours with 3 injections and 30 mg protein in total, and let the mixture spin in the refrigerator for 15 hours. The refolding mixture was then dialyzed against 20mM Tris (pH 8.0) for 36 hours, changing buffer about every 12 hours. Finally, the mixture was filtered and purified using weak anion exchange resin (DEAE cellulose, Santa Page 16 / 25 Cruz Biotechnologies) followed by purification via size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75pg, GE Healthcare). Samples of every step were collected for SDS-PAGE analysis. HLA-A2 ELISA 96-well U-bottomed plates were coated with 100\u00b5L of 0.5\u00b5g/mL streptavidin (BioLegend Cat#270302) at room temperature (18-25\u00b0C) for 16-18 hours, washed for 3 times with Washing Buffer (BioLegend Cat#421601) and blocked with Dilution Buffer (0.5M Tris pH 8.0, 1M NaCl, 1% BSA, 0.2% Tween 20) at room temperature for 30 min.

Staining of cell-surface CD8 and tetramer PBMC were isolated from peripheral venous blood of healthy donors and convalescent COVID-19 patients. The HLA-A2+ donors were identified by using flow cytometry. Briefly, 10 6 PBMC were stained with FITC anti-human HLA-A2 antibody at 4 \u00b0C in the dark for 30 min, and acquired by using flow cytometer. HLA-A2 positive PBMC samples were further stained with PE labelled tetramer (home-made)and APC labelled human CD8+ antibody (BioLegend Cat#344721), and acquired with flow cytometer FACS Canto (BD).T cell activationHLA-A2 expressing T2A2 cells were loaded with peptides for subsequent T cell activation. Briefly, T2A2 cells were pretreated with mitomycin for 30 min to stop cell proliferation, and incubated with given epitope peptides for 4 hours for peptide loading. 0.5x10 6 CD8+ T cells from health donors were co-cultured with 0.5x10 6 mixed peptide-loaded T2A2 cells stained with CFSE, and stimulated with 1\u00b5g/mL PHARM, Recombinant Human Interleukin-2( 125 Ala) Injection). 50 IU/mL IL-2 and 20\u00b5M peptides (n-Sp1, 2, 6, 7, 11, 13 and 14) were supplemented every two days. The T cell activation marker CD69 (BioLegend Cat#310909), tetramer specific CD8+ T cells proportion and apoptosis marker Annexin V-APC (BioLegend Cat#640919) on T2A2 cells were evaluated after 16 hours and 7 days, respectively. On day 7, cells were re-stimulated with peptides for 6 hours in the presence of GolgiPlug and GolgiStop (BD Cat#550583) plus 50 IU/mL IL-2, and the production of IFN-\u03b3 was checked with anti-IFN-\u03b3-PE (BioLegend Cat#506507) staining.",
