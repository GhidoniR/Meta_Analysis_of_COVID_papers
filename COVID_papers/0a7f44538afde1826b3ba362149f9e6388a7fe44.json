The first case of COVID-19 in Morocco was reported on 2 March 2020, and the number of reported cases has increased day by day. In this work, we extend the well-known SIR compartmental model to deterministic and stochastic time-delayed models in order to predict the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 in Morocco and to assess the potential role of multiple preventive measures and strategies imposed by Moroccan authorities. The main features of the work include the well-posedness of the models and conditions under which the COVID-19 may become extinct or persist in the population. Parameter values have been estimated from real data and numerical simulations are presented for forecasting the COVID-19 spreading as well as verification of theoretical results.",

In addition, Morocco declared a health emergency during the period from 20 March to 20 April 2020 and gradually extended it until 10 June 2020 in order to control the spread of the disease. In this paper, we report the assessment of the evolution of COVID-19 outbreak in Morocco. Besides shedding light on the dynamics of the pandemic, the practical intent of our analysis is to provide officials with the tendency of COVID-19 spreading, as well as gauge the effects of preventives measures using mathematical tools. Several other papers developed mathematical models for COVID-19 for particular regions in the globe and particular intervals of time, e.g., in [1] a Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) model to the analysis of data from the Brazilian Department of Health, obtained from 26 February 2020 to 25 March 2020 is proposed to better understand the early evolution of COVID-19 in Brazil; in [2] , a new COVID-19 epidemic model with media coverage and quarantine is constructed on the basis of the total confirmed new cases in the UK from 1 February 2020 to 23 March 2020; arXiv:2102.04260v1 [q-bio.PE] 4 Feb 2021",

It follows from the theory of functional differential equations [16] that system (1) with initial conditions (\u03d5 1 , \u03d5 2 , \u03d5 3 , \u03d5 4 , \u03d5 5 , \u03d5 6 , \u03d5 7 , \u03d5 8 ) \u2208 C has a unique solution. On the other hand, due to continuous fluctuation in the environment, the parameters of the system are actually not absolute constants and always fluctuate randomly around some average value. Hence, using delayed stochastic differential equations (DSDEs) to model the epidemic provide some additional degree of realism compared to their deterministic counterparts. The parameters \u03b2 and \u03b1 play an important role in controlling and preventing COVID-19 spreading and they are not completely known, but subject to some random environmental effects. We introduce randomness into system (1) by applying the technique of parameter perturbation, which has been used by many researchers (see, e.g., [17] [18] [19] ). In agreement, we replace the parameters \u03b2 and \u03b1 by \u03b2 \u2192 \u03b2 + \u03c3 1\u1e021 (t) and \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b1 + \u03c3 2\u1e022 (t), where B 1 (t) and B 2 (t) are independent standard Brownian motions defined on a complete probability space (\u2126, F , P) with a filtration {F t } t\u22650 satisfying the usual conditions (i.e., it is increasing and right continuous while F 0 contains all P-null sets) and \u03c3 i represents the intensity of B i for i = 1, 2. Therefore, we obtain the following model governed by delayed stochastic differential equations:",

Through this method, we estimated \u03b2 as 0.4517 (95%CI, 0.4484-0.455). Since the life expectancy for symptomatic individuals is 21 days on average and the crude mortality ratio is between 3% to 4% [25] , we estimated \u00b5 s = 0.01/21 per day and \u03b7 s = 0.8/21 per day. Furthermore, since the hospitals are not yet saturated and the epidemic situation is under control, we assume that mortality comes mainly from critical forms with a percentage of 40% for an average period of 13.5 days [25] . Then, we choose \u00b5 c = 0.4/13.5 per day and r c = 0.6/13.5 per day. According to [26] , the proportion of asymptomatic individuals varies from 20.6% to 39.9% and of symptomatic individuals from 60.1% and 79.4% of the infected population. The progression rates \u03b3 b , \u03b3 g and \u03b3 c , from symptomatic infected individuals to the three forms, are assumed to be 80% of diagnosed cases for benign form, 15% of diagnosed cases for severe form, and 5% of diagnosed cases for critical form, respectively [25] . The incubation period is estimated to be 5.5 days [27, 28] while the time needed before hospitalization is to be 7.5 days [29] [30] [31] . Following a clinical observation related to the situation of COVID-19 in Morocco, an evolution of symptomatic individuals is estimated towards recovery or death after 21 days without any clinical intervention. In the case when clinical intervention is applied, we estimate the evolution of the critical forms towards recovery or death after 13.3 days. The rest of the parameter values are shown in Table 1 .

In addition, the last daily reported cases in Morocco [32], confirm the biological tendency of our model. Thus, our models are efficient to describe the spread of COVID-19 in Morocco. However, we note that some clinical data are far from the values of the models due to certain foci that appeared in some large areas or at the level of certain industrial areas. We conclude also that the stochastic behavior of COVID-19 presents certain particularities contrary to the deterministic one, namely the magnitude of its peak is higher and the convergence to eradication is faster. On the other hand, the conditions in Theorems 2 and 3 are verified. More precisely, the basic reproduction number R 0 = 0.5230 is less than one from 12 May 2020 and \u03c3 2 1 = 1.0609 > 1.0598 =",

These models provide us with the evolution and prediction of important categories of individuals to be monitored, namely, the positive diagnosed cases, which can help to examine the efficiency of the measures implemented in Morocco, and the different developed forms, which can quantify the capacity of the public health system as well as the number of new deaths. Firstly, we have shown that our models are mathematically and biologically well posed by proving global existence and uniqueness of positive solutions. Secondly, the extinction of the disease was established. By analyzing the characteristic equation, we proved that if R 0 < 1, then the disease free equilibrium of the deterministic model is locally asymptotically stable (Theorem 2). Based on the Lyapunov analysis method, a sufficient condition for the extinction was obtained in the stochastic case (Theorem 3). Thirdly, and since there is a substantial interest in estimating the parameters, we applied the least square method to determine the confidence interval of the transmission rate \u03b2 as 0.4517 (95%CI, 0.4484-0.455). In addition, the rest of the parameters were either assumed, based on some daily observations, or taken from the available literature. Finally, some numerical simulations were performed to gather information in order to be able to fight against the propagation of the new coronavirus. In 12 May 2020, the basic reproduction number was less than one (R 0 = 0.5230), which means that the epidemic was tending toward eradication, which is conditional on strict compliance with the implemented measures. Currently, the consequences of the measures taken against COVID-19 in Morocco encourage their maintenance to control the spread of the epidemic and quickly move towards extinction.",
