            "text": "Background: Hybrid professionalism is one of the most effective ways to involve clinicians in management practices and responsibilities. With this study we investigated the perceptions of doctors and nurses on hybridization in clinical directorates (CDs) in hospitals. Methods: We investigated the attitudes of healthcare professionals (doctors and nurses) towards eight hospital CDs in the Local Health Authority (LHA) of Bologna (Emilia Romagna, Italy) 6 years after their implementation. We used a validated questionnaire by Braithwaite and Westbrook (2004) . Drawing on Palmer et al. (2007), we added a section about the characteristics of department heads. In all, 123 healthcare professionals in managerial roles completed and returned the questionnaire. The return rate was 47.4% for doctors and 31.6% for nurses. Results: Doctors reported an increase in clinical governance, interdisciplinarity collaboration, and standardization of clinical work. Hybridization of practices was noted to have taken place. While doctors did not see these changes as a threat to professional values, they felt that hospital managers had taken greater control. There was a large overlap of attitudes between doctors and nurses: inter-professional integration in CDs fostered alignment of values and aims. The polarity index was higher for responses from the doctors than from the nurses. Conclusion: The study findings have implications for policy makers and managers: mission and strategic mandate of CDs; governance of CDs, leadership issues; opportunities for engaging healthcare professionals; changes in managerial involvement during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also discuss the limitations of the present study and future areas for research into hybrid structures.",

To overcome resistance from clinicians, forms of \"hybrid\" professionalism, i.e., managerial roles and responsibilities assigned to professionals, have been envisioned as a means to bridge the gap between the two worlds [2] [3] [4] . The involvement of doctors in management can be viewed as a potential response to societal and patient needs in a move to improve patient centeredness and efficiency, quality, and efficacy of services [5, 6] . It can foster greater collaboration among specialties, sharing of resources, and creation of healthcare pathways; it can enhance clinical governance, minimizing the friction between two apparently contrasting sets of values and cultures [7] . Yet after 30 years of experimentation, many healthcare organizations still struggle with implementing hybrid professionalism [2, 8] .",

However, hybrid (also termed managed) professionalism has the potential for achieving meaningful synthesis of the competing values embedded in the logics of management and professionalism: the former more focused on population groups and services efficiently delivered within allocated resources, the latter more focused on individual patients, preservation of clinical autonomy, and primacy of the medical specialty [12] . This is consistent with the scholarship on how competing institutional logics can coexist and hybridize [13, 14] . Professionals were found able to blend or overlap managerial and clinical values and practices [15] , bringing organization into the professional sphere [16] . A reshaped model of professional work that can interact with organizational demands is arising and gaining legitimacy among practitioners [17] .",

What is also important to understand is how hybrid professionalism unfolds within mixed structures, i.e., systems that embed professionalism within organizational contexts in which organizational structures become more dominant as they restrain professional autonomies and hybridize professional work. A contextualized understanding of hybridization can be gained by studying how organizational interventions solve the conflict between professional and organizational logics and its impact on individual identities. To do this, we need to bridge the literature on hybridity and professional identities, with its typical focus on the individual (e.g., [7, 18] ), with the literature on organizational change and health services, and processes of change within professional organizations (e.g., [19] ).",

Different from previous studies on rank-and-file professionals, our study population was doctors who were already in leadership positions. From this original perspective we were able to address issues specific to the Italian context, in which unit chiefs are responsible for the management of physical assets (beds, operating rooms, technologies, etc.), finance and human resources (conventionally, also nursing staff are subordinated to the heads of specialty units). Here we compared the doctors' perspective to that of nurse managers, whose views on the managerialization of physicians has been marginally studied in the literature on hybrids. Our research questions were \"How do doctors view the development of hybrid professionalism within clinical directorates?\" and \"Do the attitudes of doctors and nurses differ?\". Finally, while most studies used qualitative methodologies, for our study we used a mixed approach to measure diverse dimensions of hybrid professionalism via a self-report questionnaire [22] that investigates the views and attitudes of professionals towards CDs. We added a section with open-ended questions to the questionnaire.",

CDs in hospitals have been found to be one of the finest examples of how doctors can take managerial positions in hospital organizations [23, 24] . These intermediate management structures group clinical specialties together to improve clinical governance, efficiency [25] , resource management, decision-making [26, 27] and service delivery [28] . CDs can foster a style of interaction and interdisciplinary teamwork that is more collaborative than the conventional hierarchy of following \"doctor's orders\" [29] because it reduces the disciplinary self-referentiality that creates \"tribes\" in the clinical organization [30] . They are headed by a clinical director, i.e., a medical professional who coordinates the activity of colleagues as primus inter pares. They work much like \"two-way windows\" [7] : acting on the behalf of colleagues towards executives and as middle managers representing executives towards professionals [31] . Clinical directors are usually appointed for a fixed period and then return to their clinical activity when the mandate expires; usually they are part-time managers who maintain their clinical practice. This organizational form, which is a shift from traditional hospital professional bureaucracies to divisionalized organizational forms [32] , was first introduced in the United States in the late 1970's [33] . It was subsequently adopted by healthcare organizations in many Western countries, including Scandinavia and continental Europe [34] . They have attracted the interest of organizational and health services scholars fascinated by the variety of forms of hybrid professionalism (e.g., [4, 10, [35] [36] [37] ).",

For example, CDs can result in divisionalized professional bureaucracies [24] where traditional professionalism and medical autonomy of the operating core is reinforced rather than reduced, since practicing physicians are not exposed to new managerial work practices. The professional values and interests of doctors remain autonomous from those of management when no increased administrative control or loss of autonomy in decision-making is experienced [24] . As a consequence, one needs to determine whether and to what extent hybrid structures like CDs really do succeed in creating hybrid professionalism, changing what people do and how they do it [40] .",

They had wide legal and managerial responsibility for physical assets (beds, operating rooms, etc.) and staff (both clinicians and nurses). With the advent of the managerialization reforms in 1992, all public hospitals were required to create CDs in their organizational chart and integrate diverse medical specialty units. The chiefs of CDs were selected from among the heads of specialty units. They were practicing physicians who were assigned responsibilities over strategic decision making, budgeting, and clinical governance of the CD [30] . In some instances, CDs had their own budgets which were then divided among the units, while more often resources were negotiated between the chief executive officer (CEO) and each unit chief. Clinical directors were also members on the board of clinical directors, acting mostly as an advisory body for the CEO. Initially, CDs gained traction due to isomorphic pressures rather than rational strategy making [41] . Over time, the effective engagement of doctors as clinical directors increased and CDs were enacted. The aim of the CDs was to overcome the clinical and organizational fragmentation that generated inefficiencies typical of the functional structure built around medical specialty units and widely adopted by Italian hospitals. The CDs had to meet various different organizational needs through the integration of diverse specialty units: 1) better clinical governance via the definition of integrated clinical pathways; 2) reduced inefficiencies and exploitation of economies of scale by sharing physical assets, nursing staff, and technologies; 3) restrict the span of control by CEOs, who interact with a few heads of CDs rather than numerous unit chiefs [30] .",

The cross-hospital CDs were firstly introduced in 2005 to improve the governance of the network and the coordination in decisionmaking and internal reorganization of the clinical units. On average, each of the eight CDs in place at the time of the study comprised 12 medical specialty units, grouped according to disciplinary proximity and each managed by a unit chief.

It is structured in six sections (clinician issues, working relationships, coordination and management, decentralization, organizational performance, final questions, and comments). It was translated into Italian and slightly adapted to the Italian NHS context. Back-translation was performed to check for content accuracy. We added a section on the clinical director's role and his/her hybrid nature. In this way, we incorporated aspects that had emerged in preliminary interviews with hospital executives and from the literature [43] . The final version of the questionnaire was composed of 65 items: 60 had five possible responses on a Likert-like scale from 5, strongly agree (SA), to 1, strongly disagree (SD). 1 The questionnaire was posted on the LHA intranet with a cover letter that explained the purpose of the survey. The respondents were invited to complete the questionnaire and return it via email between November 2011 and January 2012. Responses were anonymous. The sample was the unit chiefs and nurse managers who worked in one of the eight CDs. The study sample was 123 staff members: the return rate was 47.4% for doctors and 31.6% for nurses; 60% were unit chiefs and 40% nurse managers. Respondents came from different CDs, the majority from the larger CDs. The average age of the sample was relatively high, especially for the doctors, because it was composed of professionals in a managerial position. Moreover, the average age of Italian doctorsirrespective of their organizational role -in 2013 was 51.6 years [44] . The chiefs of the CDs were all men.

Following Braithwaite and Westbrook [22] , three additional percentages were calculated for each item and then averaged for each questionnaire section. These measured the uncertainty, the intensity, and the polarity of the attitudes the respondents expressed. The polarity index (PI) is particularly relevant as it gives a measure of the spread of the group's attitudes. An item with low polarity will have responses clustered at either the agree or the disagree end of the scale, whereas an item with high polarity will have a percentage of respondents who agree with the item approximately equal to the percentage of those who disagree. 2 In previous studies [22, 42] the questionnaire was used to study staff attitudes toward CDs irrespective of a respondent's profession. For the present study, following Braithwaite and Westbrook [29] we analyzed the responses and report the data in a comparison between doctors and nurses. This was done to understand physicians' attitudes and to explore similarities and differences between the two groups. In the analysis of the qualitative data we identified concepts in the empirical material and grouped them into categories according to the comments given by the respondents. Data interpretation was performed by iteratively triangulating between quali-quantitative data and organizational theory on hybrids in healthcare.

While the doctors stated that their influence within the organization was limited and that the new model diminished their power, the nurses had contrary opinions, claiming that doctors have powerful control over organizational forces that oppose processes of change.

The challenges of specific contexts need to be understood before implementing change processes to address cultural issues and professional values and behaviors.

Assessment of professionals' perceptions is the first step to address issues, problems, and opportunities on which healthcare executives can act to improve organizational development and change in their organizations. Our findings on hybrid professionalism show that contingency matters, i.e., that the contextual features of a healthcare system need to be considered in order to make sense of diverse patterns of accommodation between medicine and management [23] . Our findings differ from those reported by studies conducted in the UK, the United States, and Scandinavia, and from the results of the study by Correia and Denis [24] .

It would be desirable to see studies conducted using different quantitative methodologies, which still are relatively scarce in the field, or studies replicating the questionnaire developed by Braithwaite and Westbrook [22] in other healthcare systems. Furthermore, the data presented here were collected some years ago and may not represent the current situation at the hospital. This limitation notwithstanding, the institutional-legal framework has not changed in the last 10 years and CDs form the main organizational building blocks of healthcare organizations in Italy. Also, the LHA we studied was one of the first in the Italian NHS to establish CDs. This pioneer role makes the LHA of Bologna a perfect context to study the responses of professionals to the CDs in the phase of consolidation. It offers findings for other Italian healthcare organizations that are now developing (not only formally) or consolidating their CDs and also for other healthcare organizations throughout the world which are starting to develop the clinical directorates model and/or are facing similar challenges. The debate surrounding hybrid professionalism has progressed in the last 15 years, and new forms of involvement of doctors in management besides CDs have emerged which introduced matrix-like organizational forms, such as [48] : 1) clinical centers that coordinate care delivery for specific health problem and patient flows (e.g., cardiovascular, neuroscience, orthopedics, frail patients, inflammatory diseases), 2) multidisciplinary and multiprofessional teams across CDs for organizing clinical activity.

First, the mission and mandate of a CD need to be carefully designed. The CD model is usually meant as an intermediate organizational layer in a hospital's hierarchy. It is increasingly common to find other forms of integration of clinical specialties, however, in which the aim is to re-organize delivery processes, design and implement clinical pathways, share technologies or physical resources. This is consistent with recent trends in hospital organization that are based on a matrix design: clinical centers, multidisciplinary and multiprofessional teams. This may help to mitigate some power issues which become less problematic when money and higher up hierarchical positions are not involved.",

For instance, forming a team to manage CDs, as it is not a one-man job. In detail, a strong nursing manager on the team is of paramount importance, as he/she can support clinicians in their transition toward hybrid roles. A critical point, however, is that executives and organizational designers need to carefully monitor how power is distributed across professions within the organization. Conflict between doctors and nurses is not new in healthcare, and our findings show that new hybrid organizational models can exacerbate fractures rather than prevent them.",

Clearly, there is a specific point here: whoever manages a CD has to develop specific routines and processes to engage clinicians and health staff in conversation, dialogue, decision-making, evaluation of goals and performance. If professionals perceive that the new model has restricted their participation in management and governance, leaving the real say to executives and clinical directors-as shown in a skeptical quote reported aboveit will be difficult to engage them. To give a metaphor, clinicians and health staff may be willing to row if involved in steering the boat. In this context, the responses to questionnaire items investigating coordination and management issues shed light but also cast shadows on the functioning of CDs as a \"middle\" layer of operations management. If on one hand, respondents thought that CDs generate unprecedented opportunities to develop multidisciplinary and multiprofessional work, on the other there was a high percentage that signaled situations of conflict and silo dynamics across CDs. Again, executives will need to invest heavily in generating opportunities for in-depth engagement of professionals by developing coordination mechanisms and managerial tools -symbols, logos, narratives, story-tellingin order to create a sense of belonging to the hospital at large. Fourth, while many professionals acknowledged that CDs can facilitate new ways of working, based on multidisciplinarity, teamwork, and multiprofessional integration, they were somewhat pessimistic about whether such improvements actually increased patientcenteredness. This response was not unexpected, as many clinicians and health staff may have felt reassured in having resources and processes under control inside their own unit, just like in the traditional organizational model. Therefore, hybrid managers will need to produce evidence of the benefit of CDs for patients and to document the legitimacy of these hybrid roles and systems in the eyes of professionals.",

First, the average age of the sample was relatively high because it was composed of professionals in managerial positions who arrived there after many years of work within the organization, especially the doctors. In future, this questionnaire can be advantageously administered to junior professionals not yet in a managerial position. Second, it would be interesting to analyze the differences in the responses by sex and age of the respondents, variables available from the current dataset of the study, but also from the perspective of educational background (e.g., medical specialties) and previous managerial training (e.g., executive management programs) of professionals, as suggested by studies on management education and training in clinical hybrid roles and their influence in achieving specific kinds of performance (mainly, service quality and financial efficiency) in healthcare organizations [49] .",

During the pandemic, doctors and nurses alike have been called not only to provide effective and efficient care but also to share in crisis management decisions and actions to tackle the emergency. There are multiple areas of managerial engagement [50] : professionals with managerial responsibility (such as CDs directors) have been involved in the work and the decisions in crisis units; professionals within CDs have had to rapidly adapt their decisions and their organizational processes, convert their organization's physical assets (beds, operating rooms, intensive care units, etc.), and deal with shortages in resources (e.g., PPE, equipment, invasive and non-invasive ventilators, swab tests), as well as introduce digital technologies for handling outpatient visits and telemonitoring patients at home or in managed facilities (e.g., Patient-Centered Medical Home or Patient Hotels). It would be interesting to analyze the changes in perceptions on CDs via a longitudinal study that could yield interesting insights into the impact of the COVID-19 emergency on the views of professionals about their involvement in CDs and in managerial responsibilities. This will be our future area of focus.",
