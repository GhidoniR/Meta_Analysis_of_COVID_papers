Perceptual datasets gathered for this purpose have provided useful benchmarks for improving IQA methods, but their heavy use creates a risk of overfitting. Here, we perform a large-scale comparison of IQA models in terms of their use as objectives for the optimization of image processing algorithms. Specifically, we use eleven full-reference IQA models to train deep neural networks for four low-level vision tasks: denoising, deblurring, super-resolution, and compression. Subjective testing on the optimized images allows us to rank the competing models in terms of their perceptual performance, elucidate their relative advantages and disadvantages in these tasks, and propose a set of desirable properties for incorporation into future IQA models.",

IQA models are generally classified according to their reliance on the availability of an original reference image. Full-reference methods compare a distorted image to the complete reference image, reducedreference methods require only partial information about the reference image, and no-reference (or blind) methods operate solely on the distorted image. The standard paradigm for Communicated by Daniel Scharstein. testing IQA models is to compare them to human quality ratings of distorted images, which have been made available in datasets such as LIVE ) and TID2013 (Ponomarenko et al. 2015) . However, excessive reuse of these test sets during IQA model development may lead to overfitting, and as a consequence, poor generalization to images corrupted by distortions that are not present in the test sets (see Table 4 ).",

The parameters of image processing methods are usually adjusted to minimize the mean squared error (MSE), the simplest of all fidelity metrics, despite the fact that it has been widely criticised for its poor correlation with human perception of image quality (Girod 1993) . Early attempts at perceptual optimization using the structural similarity (SSIM) index (Wang et al. 2004 ) in place of MSE achieved perceptual gains in applications of image restoration (Channappayya et al. 2008) , wireless video streaming (Vukadinovic and Karlsson 2009) , video coding , and image synthesis (Snell et al. 2017) .

To determine their suitability for optimization, we first test the models on recovering a reference image from a given initialization by optimizing the model-reported distance to the reference. For many IQA methods, we find that the optimization does not converge to the reference image, and can generate severe distortions. These optima are either local, or global but non-unique. We select eleven optimization-suitable IQA models as perceptual objectives, and use them to optimize DNNs for four low-level vision tasks-image denoising, blind image deblurring, single image super-resolution, and lossy image compression. Extensive human perceptual tests on the optimized images reveal the relative performance of the competing models. Moreover, inspection of their visual failures indicates limitations in model design, providing guidance for the development of future IQA models.",

The MSE in particular possesses useful properties for optimization (e.g., differentiability and convexity), and when combined with linear-algebraic tools, analytical solutions can often be obtained. For example, the classical solution to the MSE-optimal denoising problem (assuming a translation-invariant Gaussian signal model) is the Wiener filter (Wiener 1950) . Given that MSE in the pixel domain is poorly correlated with perceived image quality, many IQA models operate by first mapping images to more perceptually appropriate representations (Safranek and Johnston 1989; Daly 1992; Lubin 1993; Watson 1993; Teo and Heeger 1994; Watson et al. 1997; Larson and Chandler 2010; Laparra et al. 2016) , and measuring MSE within that space. -Structural similarity (SSIM) methods are constructed to measure the similarity of local image \"structures\", often using correlation measures. The prototype is the SSIM index (Wang et al. 2004) , which combines similarity measures of three conceptually independent componentsluminance, contrast and structure. It has become a de facto standard in the field of perceptual image processing, and provided a prototype for subsequent IQA models based on feature similarity (Zhang et al. 2011) , gradient similarity (Liu et al. 2012a) , edge strength similarity , and saliency similarity ).",

Statistical modeling of the image source, the distortion process, and the human visual system (HVS) is critical in algorithm development.

By leveraging the power of DNNs, these methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance on existing image quality databases (Bosse et al. 2018; Prashnani et al. 2018) . But given the high dimensionality of the input space (i.e., millions of pixels), these methods are prone to overfitting the limited available data. Strategies that compensate for the insufficiency of labeled training data include building on pre-trained networks Ding et al. 2020) , training on local image patches (Bosse et al. 2018) , and combining multiple IQA databases (Zhang et al. 2019b ). -Fusion-based methods combine existing IQA methods to build a \"super-evaluator\" that exploits the diversity and complementarity of their constituent methods (analogous to \"boosting\" methods in machine learning). Fusion combinations can be determined empirically (Ye et al. 2014) or learned from data (Liu et al. 2012b; Ma et al. 2019) . Some methods incorporate deterministic or statistical image priors to regularize an IQA measure (Jordan 1881; Ulyanov et al. 2018 ).

Starting from (a) a white Gaussian noise image, we recover images by optimizing the predicted quality relative to a reference image, using different IQA models (b)-(r) ered image. For example, if D is MSE, the (trivial) analytical solution is y = x, indicating full recoverability. The majority of current IQA models are continuous and differentiable, and solutions must be obtained numerically using gradientbased iterative solvers. We considered an initial set of 17 methods, which we believe cover the full spectrum of fullreference IQA methods. These include three error visibility methods-MAD (Larson and Chandler 2010) , PAMSE ) and NLPD , seven structural similarity methods-MS-SSIM (Wang et al. 2003) , CW-SSIM (Wang and Simoncelli 2005) , FSIM (Zhang et al. 2011) , SFF (Chang et al. 2013) , GMSD (Xue et al. 2014) and VSI , MCSD , two information-theoretical methods-IFC (Sheikh et al. 2005) and VIF , and five DNN methods-GTI-CNN (Ma et al. 2018) , DeepIQA (Bosse et al. 2018) , PieAPP (Prashnani et al. 2018) , LPIPS and DISTS (Ding et al. 2020) . As this paper focuses on the perceptual optimization performance of individual IQA measures, fusion-based methods are not included. Figures 1 and 2 show recovery results from two different initializations-a white Gaussian noise image and a JPEGcompressed version of a reference image, respectively. For all IQA methods, the optimization converges to a final image with a substantially better score than that of the initial image. Models based on injective mappings such as MS-SSIM, PAMSE, NLPD and DISTS are able to recover the reference image (although the rate of convergence may depend on the choice of initial image). Many of the remaining IQA models generate a final image with worse visual quality than that of the initial image (e.g., compare Fig. 2 (a) with (o) or (p)), often with noticeable model-dependent artifacts. This is because these methods rely on surjective mapping functions to transform the images to a reduced \"perceptual\" space for quality computation. For example, GTI-CNN (Ma et al. 2018 ) uses a surjective DNN with four stages of convolution, subsampling, and halfwave rectification. The resulting undercomplete representation is optimized for geometric transformation invariance, at the cost of significant information loss. The examples demonstrate that preservation of some aspects of this lost information is important for perceptual quality. Similar arguments can be applied to other surjective DNN-based IQA models, such as DeepIQA (Bosse et al. 2018) and PieAPP (Prashnani et al. 2018) . Generally, optimization guided by the surjective models \"recovers\" more structures when initialized with the JPEG image (which provides roughly correct local luminances), as compared to initialization with purely white Gaussian noise.",

            "text": "3. VIF , the Visual Information Fidelity measure, quantifies how much information from the reference image is preserved in the distorted image. A Gaussian scale mixture (Portilla et al. 2003 ) is used as a source model to summarize natural image statistics, and mutual information is estimated assuming only signal attenuation and additive noise perturbations. A distinct property of VIF relative to other IQA models is that it can handle cases in which the \"distorted\" image is visually superior to the reference . 4. CW-SSIM (Wang and Simoncelli 2005) , the Complex Wavelet SSIM index, is designed to be robust to small geometric distortions such as translation and rotation. The construction allows for consistent local phase shifts of wavelet coefficients, which preserves image features. CW-SSIM addresses a common limitation of IQA methods that require precise spatial registration of the reference and distorted images. 5. MAD (Larson and Chandler 2010) , the Most Apparent Distortion measure, explicitly models adaptive strategies of the HVS. Specifically, a detection-based strategy considering local luminance and contrast masking is employed for near-threshold distortions, and an appearance-based strategy involving local spatial-frequency statistics is activated for supra-threshold distortions. The two strategies are combined by a weighted geomet-ric mean, where the weight is determined based on the amount of distortion. 6. FSIM (Zhang et al. 2011) , the Feature SIMilarity index, assumes that HVS understands an image mainly according to its low-level features. It computes quality estimates based on phase congruency (Kovesi 1999) as the primary feature, and incorporates the gradient magnitude as the complementary feature. Moreover, the phase congruency component serves as a local weighting factor to derive an overall quality score. FSIM also supplies a color version by making quality measurements from chromatic components. 7. GMSD (Xue et al. 2014) , the Gradient Magnitude Similarity Deviation, focuses on computational efficiency of quality prediction, by simply computing pixel-wise gradient magnitude similarity followed by standard deviation (std) pooling. This pooling strategy is, however, problematic because an image with large but constant local distortion yields an std of zero (indicating the best predicted quality). 8. VSI , the Visual Saliency Induced quality index, assumes that the change of salient regions due to image degradation is closely related to the change of visual quality. The saliency map is used not only as a quality feature, but also as a weighting function to characterize the importance of a local region. By combining saliency magnitude, gradient magnitude and chromatic features, VSI demonstrates good quality prediction performance, especially for localized distortions, such as local patch substitution (Ponomarenko et al. 2015) . 9. NLPD , the Normalized Laplacian Pyramid Distance, mimics the nonlinear transformations of the early visual system: local luminance subtraction and local gain control, and combines these values using weighted p -norms. The parameters are optimized to minimize the representation redundancies, instead of matching human judgments. NLPD has been successfully employed to optimize image rendering algorithms Laparra et al. 2017) , where the input reference image has a much higher dynamic range than that of the display. It has also been used to optimize a compression system ). 10. LPIPS , the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity model, computes the Euclidean distance between deep representations of two images. The authors showed that feature maps of different DNN architectures have \"reasonable\" effectiveness in accounting for human perception of image quality. As LPIPS has many different configurations, we chose the default one based on the VGG network (Simonyan and Zisserman 2015) with the weights learned from the BAPPS dataset . VGG-based LPIPS can be seen as a generalization of the \"perceptual loss\" (Johnson et al. 2016) , which com-putes the Euclidean distance on convolution responses from one stage of VGG. 11. DISTS (Ding et al. 2020) , the Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity metric, is explicitly designed to tolerate texture resampling (e.g., replacing one patch of grass with another). DISTS is based on an injective mapping function built from a variant of the VGG network, and combines SSIM-like structure and texture similarity measurements between corresponding feature maps of the two images. It is sensitive to structural distortions but at the same time robust to texture resampling and modest geometric transformations.",

Successful blind deblurring methods, such as (Fergus et al. 2006; Pan et al. 2016) , rely heavily on statistical priors of natural images and geometric priors of blur kernels. With the success of deep learning, many DNNbased approaches (Tao et al. 2018; Kupyn et al. 2018) attempt to directly learn the mapping function for blind deblurring without explicitly estimating the blur kernel. Here we also adopted this \"kernel-free\" approach to train a DNN for image deblurring in an end-to-end fashion.

Second, models that require backpropagating gradients through multiple stages of computation (e.g., LPIPS and DISTS) converge much faster.

Thus, there is no single IQA model that performs best across all tasks. We ascribe this to differences in the nature of the tasks: denoising requires distinguishing signal and noise, deblurring, super-resolution, and compression all require recovery of discarded information from partial deterministic measurements (for the first two, via linear projection, and for compression via quantization). MS-SSIM and MAE are both known to prefer smooth appearances, and are seen to excel at denoising. Both DISTS and LPIPS explicitly represent aspects of fine textures, and are superior for the remaining three tasks.

We refer interested readers to \"Appendix 1\" for more comparisons on several IQA databases dedicated to low-level vision problems.",

            "text": "In this subsection, we show example images produced by each IQA-optimized method, qualitatively summarize the types of visual distortion, and use them to diagnose the shortcomings of the corresponding IQA models. Figure 10 shows denoising results for the \"cat\" image. We observe that MAE, MS-SSIM, and NLPD do a good job in denoising flat regions, but tend to over-smooth texture regions. VIF encourages detail enhancement, leading to artificial local contrast, while GMSD produces a relatively dark appearance presumably because it discards local luminance information. Moreover, the results of FSIM and VSI exhibit noticeable artifacts. LPIPS and DISTS preserve fine details, but may not fully remove noise in smooth regions, mistaking the remaining noise as visually plausible texture. Overall, traditional IQA models MAE and MS-SSIM denoise images with various content variations robustly, keeping high-frequency information loss within the acceptable range. This may explain why they are the dominant objective functions for this task. Figure 11 shows deblurring results for the \"basket\" image. We see that most of the IQA methods fail, but in different ways. Specifically, the results of MAE, MS-SSIM, CW-SSIM, and NLPD are quite blurred. FSIM, GMSD, and VSI generate severe ringing artifacts. VIF again fails to adjust the local contrast. MAD exhibits undesirable white dot artifacts, although the main structures are sharp. LPIPS succeeds in deblurring this example, while DISTS produces a result that is closest to the original. This is consistent with current stateof-the-art deblurring results (Kupyn et al. 2019) , generated by incorporating comparison of the VGG features into the loss. Figure 12 shows super-resolution results for the \"corner tower\" image. Again, MAE, MS-SSIM, NLPD, and especially CW-SSIM produce somewhat blurred images, without recovering fine details. MAD, FSIM, GMSD, and VSI are able to generate some \"structures\", but these are perceived as unpleasant model-dependent artifacts. Benefiting from its texture synthesis capability, DISTS has the potential to super-resolve perceptually plausible fine details, although they differ from those of the original image. Figure 13 shows compression results for the \"airplane\" image at 0.24 \u00b1 0.01 bpp. A JPEG image, compressed to 0.25 bpp, suffers from block and blur artifacts. Overall, the main structures of the original image are well preserved for most IQA models, but the fine details (e.g., the grass) have to be discarded at this low bitrate, or are synthesized with other forms of distortion. VIF reconstitutes a desaturated image with over-enhanced global contrast, and CW-SSIM superimposes periodic artifacts on the underlying image. White dots and ringing artifacts are again apparent in the results of MAD and VSI, respectively. The image by NLPD is blurred and red-shifted. Both LPIPS and DISTS succeed in synthesizing textures that are visually similar to the original.",

            "text": "-Blurring is a frequently seen distortion type in all four of the tasks, and is mainly caused by error visibility methods (e.g., MAE and NLPD) and structural similarity methods (e.g., MS-SSIM), which rely on simple injective mappings. Specifically, MAE and SSIM work directly with pixels, and NLPD transforms the input image to a multiscale overcomplete representation using a single stage of local mean subtraction and divisive normalization. Under strict constraints imposed by the tasks, they prefer to make a more conservative estimate, producing something akin to an average of all possible outcomes with sharp structures, as would occur when optimizing MSE. -Ringing is a high-frequency distortion type that often occurs in the images optimized for FSIM, VSI and GMSD (see Fig. 11 (i)-(k)). One common characteristic of the three models is that they rely heavily (in some cases, solely) on local gradient magnitude for feature similarity comparison, underweighting (or abandoning) other perceptually important features (such as local luminance and local phase). This creates \"shortcuts\" that the DNNs can exploit, generating distortions with similar local gradient statistics. from responses of Gabor filters at multiple scales and orientations. The resulting set of statistical measurements seems insufficient to summarize natural image structures that exhibit higher-order dependencies. Therefore, MAD is \"blind\" to distortions that satisfy the same set of statistical constraints, and gives the optimized distorted image a high-quality score. -Over-enhancement of local image contrast is encouraged by VIF, which, in most of our experiments, causes significant quality degradation. We believe this arises because VIF does not fully respect reference information when normalizing the covariance term. Specifically, only the second-order statistics of the reference image are used to construct the normalization factor. By incorporating the same statistics computed from the distorted image into normalization, the problem of over-enhancement may be alleviated. In general, quality assessment of image enhancement is a challenging problem (Fang et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015) , and to the best of our knowledge, all existing full-reference IQA models fail to reward properly-enhanced cases, while penalizing overenhanced cases.",

This provides an alternative means of testing the perceptual relevance of IQA models in a practical setting, which we believe is an important complement to the conventional methodology for IQA model First, through perceptual optimization, we generated a number of distortions (different from those used in existing IQA databases), which may easily fool the respective models or models of similar design philosophies (see Table 1 ). It should be noted that the emergence of specific distortions is in principle dependent on the experimental choices (e.g., initialization strategy, model architecture, and optimization technique). Second, although they underperformed the DNN-based models on three of four applications, the standard full-reference IQA models (MS-SSIM and MAE) are still valuable tools for optimizing image processing systems due to their robustness and simplicity. Third, more recent IQA models with surjective mappings may still be used to monitor image quality and to optimize the parameter settings of image processing methods, but in a limited and well-controlled space. Last, the two DNN-based models (LPIPS and DISTS) offered the best overall performance in our experiments, but their high computational complexity and lack of interpretability may hinder their use. Our work has interesting connections to two separate lines of research. First, inspired by the philosophy of \"analy-sis by synthesis\" (Grenander 1970) , Wang and Simoncelli (2008) introduced the maximum differentiation competition methodology to automatically synthesize images for efficiently comparing IQA models. Given two IQA models, MAD generates samples in the space of all possible images that best discriminate the two models. However, the synthesized images may be highly unnatural, and in this case, of limited practical importance. Ma et al. (2020) alleviated this issue by manually constraining the search space to a finite image set of practical interest. Our approach combines the best aspects of these two methods, in the sense that the test images for model comparison are automatically generated by the trained networks, but arise as solutions of real-world vision tasks and are thus of practical importance. Second, the existence of type II adversarial examples (Szegedy et al. 2013) has exposed the vulnerability of many computer vision algorithms, where a tiny change to the input that is imperceptible to the human eye would cause the algorithm to make classification mistakes. In our case, weaknesses in an IQA model are exposed through optimized images that may be interpreted as type I \"adversarial\" examples of the model: a significant change is made to the original image that sub-stantially degrades its perceptual quality, but the model still claims that this image is of high quality.",

First, the transformation used in the IQA model should be perceptual, mapping the input images into a space where a simple distance measure (e.g., Euclidean) matches human judgements of image quality. This is in the same spirit that color scientists pursue perceptually uniform color spaces, and is an underlying principle of a number of existing models (e.g., NLPD). Zhang et al. (2018) and Ding et al. (2020) demonstrated that a cascade of linear convolution, downsampling, and rectified nonlinearity optimized for highlevel vision tasks may be a good candidate. Second, the IQA model should enjoy unique optima (i.e., the underlying mapping should be injective) to guarantee that images close to optimal are visually similar to the original. This criterion was respected by early models (e.g., MS-SSIM), but was largely overlooked in recent IQA model development. Third, the IQA model should be continuous and differentiable, with well-behaved gradients, to aid optimization in complex situations (e.g., training DNNs with millions of parameters). Last but not least, the IQA model should be computationally efficient, enabling real-time quality assessment and perceptual optimization. To the best of our knowledge, although many current IQA models possess subsets of these properties, no current IQA model satisfies them all.",

            "text": "Tables 4 and 5 show the performance comparisons of 13 IQA methods in terms of the SRCC and 2AFC scores. As suggested in Zhang et al. (2018) , the 2AFC score is computed by: pq + (1 \u2212 p)(1 \u2212 q), where p is the percentage of human votes and q = {0, 1} is the vote of an IQA model. When q agrees with the majority of human votes, the 2AFC score is larger, indicating better performance. We find that the overall performance of all models is lower compared to that in the standard IQA databases (see Table 2 ), indicating the difficulty of generalizing to unseen distortions. Moreover, DNN-based measures are relatively better than knowledgedriven models in these application-oriented databases, but there is still significant room for improvement. Figure 15 shows a quality assessment example of realworld super-resolution methods. Here we only compared the most widely used measures (PSNR and SSIM), and the two that performed best both on optimization and assessment (LPIPS and DISTS). It is not surprising that PSNR and SSIM have the poor correlation with human opinions, as they focus more on signal fidelity than perceptual quality (Blau and Michaeli 2018) . LPIPS and DISTS perform better, but the former is somewhat oversensitive to texture substitution. As many recent image restoration algorithms succeed in generating richer textures, DISTS holds much promise for use in quality assessment for such applications (Figs. 16, 17, 18 and 19) .",
