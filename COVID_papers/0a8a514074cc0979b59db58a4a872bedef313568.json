Efficient management of infectious diseases requires a top-down approach which must be complemented with a bottom-up response to be effective. Here we investigate a novel approach to surveillance for transboundary animal diseases using African Swine fever as a model. We were able to collect data at a population level on information-seeking behavior and at a local level through a targeted questionnaire-based survey to relevant stakeholders such as farmers and veterinary authorities. Our study shows how information-seeking behavior and resulting public attention during an epidemic, can be addressed through novel data streams from digital platforms such as Wikipedia. We also bring evidence on how field surveys aimed at local workers (e.g. farmers) and public authorities remain a crucial tool to assess more in-depth preparedness and awareness among front-line actors. We conclude that they should be used in combination to maximize the outcome of surveillance and prevention activities for selected transboundary animal diseases.",

These are significantly influenced by the natural environment as this influences the density of susceptible species and vectors (i.e. ticks) but also significantly by human behavior (2) . In particular, human behavior plays a key role in the transmission and geographic spread of the ASF virus (3, 4) through infringement or low compliance with biosecurity measures. Among all, the practice of swill (scraps of meat that are potentially infectious) feeding mainly in backyard farms is known to be a driver of infection. Additionally, underreporting of ASF suspected cases linked to movements of contaminated pork products and infected pigs have contributed to the ASF spread within and across countries (2, 4, 5) . The unavailability of a vaccine or treatment makes awareness programs and mass culling among the few options available for disease prevention and control (5) . ASF is a disease of wild and domestic pigs that is present in several European, African, and Asian countries and is heavily threatening their pig industries (1) . The World Health Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food Agriculture Organization (FAO) recognize awareness campaigns as essential for prevention and prompt intervention of the health authorities (6) .",

On one hand, assessing public awareness is key to develop effective communication campaigns and prevent the introduction or mitigate the spread of the disease in any given area.",

On the other hand, knowledge and attitude surveys can be adopted to assess the level of preparedness of local health authorities and field workers who are at the frontline of disease containment and prevention (12) (13) (14) . Our proposed methodology aims at combining the insight provided by digital data to assess information-seeking behavior and awareness in the general population (with a focus on Europe) with a field survey-based study in Estonia involving pig farmers and local veterinary authorities. We believe this integrated approach, when regularly implemented, could provide better insights on the level of attention of the public towards a specific hazard and risk allowing better communication strategy and ultimately, improving risk management strategies.",

The process led originally to twenty-five topics which were lately grouped into 5 main broad topics. All the authors (the majority of which have a background in veterinary sciences) were involved in the qualitative annotation of the resulting topics.

Citizens are being recommended on proper individual behaviors (e.g. proper disposal of food in recreational areas) and help implementation of passive surveillance (e.g. reporting of wild-boar carcasses from hunters and tourists to authorities). In this study, we assessed the information-seeking behavior as well as the awareness and the preparedness of ASF at two different scales (general population and target groups) intending to evaluate the applicability of an integrated approach to monitor public awareness and preparedness of health authorities and field workers based on a combination of non-traditional data sources and survey-based methodologies.",

Not the same can be said for the general population, given that digital information-seeking behavior peaked only after generalist news coverage. For these reasons, both approaches (digital and field-oriented) are valuable and needed from a public health perspective to understand how interest, risk perception, and awareness in the general population and specific interest groups evolve during an epidemic and how they may affect public opinion as well as the preparedness.",

This is relevant because official communications amplified by media coverage could effectively be leveraged to capture the public attention and stimulate information-seeking even on a longer-term after the outbreak.

Notice that the information-seeking behavior decreased after having reached the highest peak, even if the exposure to the news remained high. This was particularly evident in Estonia, Romania, Belgium, and the Czech Republic. Also, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland had similar temporal profiles, presenting multiple peaks in both Wikipedia pageviews and the volume of news during the reporting time of the ASF outbreaks. The communication of official reports of the outbreaks was not always reflected in the news volume, failing to trigger an information-seeking behavior towards the subject. This was particularly evident in Italy where, despite multiple ASF cases being reported before October 2018, Wikipedia searches only started after the first peak of news volume. These trends indicated a necessary threshold of information exposure to trigger the information-seeking behavior of the general population, which was not necessarily dependent on the surveillance reports of the outbreaks.",

Similarly, most farmers (17/22, 77.3%) thought that there is cooperation between the farmers' community and the veterinary authorities. Also, 15 out of the 22 farmers (68.2%) thought that farmers are sufficiently consulted by the veterinary authorities in terms of ASF control and 17(77.3%) agreed with the majority of the measures to prevent/control outbreaks of ASF in pigs. Out of the 22 farmers, 17 (77.3%) agreed with the majority of the measures to prevent/control outbreaks of ASF in pigs and 5 (22.7%) did not. However, 16 out of 22 farmers (72.7%) did not feel satisfied with the economic support from the government to control ASF. We assessed the level of satisfaction of the farmers (very dissatisfied, slightly dissatisfied, slightly satisfied, and very satisfied) with the veterinary and other veterinary authorities concerning ASF communication practices considering two aspects, the communication promptly to farmers on ASF-related topics during an outbreak and the content of the communication to farmers on ASF-related topics during an outbreak. About fifty-four percent (54.5%, 12/22) of respondents were slightly satisfied, 27.3% (6/22) slightly dissatisfied, 13.6% (3/22) very satisfied, and 1 respondent very dissatisfied with the timely manner of the communication to them on ASF-related topics during an outbreak. Half of the respondents (11/22, 50%) were slightly satisfied and 31.8% (7/22) were slightly dissatisfied and 18.2% (4/22) were very satisfied with the content of the communication on ASF-related topics directed to farmers during an outbreak. Also, 45.5% (10/22) of respondents felt slightly dissatisfied, 36.4% (8/22) slightly satisfied, 9.1% (2/22) very dissatisfied, and one respondent very satisfied with the farmers' involvement of the farmers' community in the national ASF control strategy. Regarding the implementation of actions by the veterinary and other veterinary authorities promptly during an ASF outbreak, 45.5% (10/22) felt slightly satisfied, 31.8% (7/22) slightly dissatisfied, 13.6% (3/22) very satisfied, and 9.1% (2/22) very satisfied. Eleven interviews were conducted with representatives of the Estonian veterinary authorities, three working at the central level and eight respondents working at the district level for the Estonian competent authorities. Interviewees were asked which main institutions and private organizations were involved in the risk management strategy of ASF in domestic pigs and wild boars in Estonia. S7 Table, in supplementary material, shows the name and the number of nominations of public institutions and private organizations mentioned by respondents. Interviewees were asked about which target groups, communication channels, and materials are used as part of the ASF communication strategy. Their answers can be found in S8 Table in the supplementary material. The coordination between public institutions and private organizations was described as good for most respondents (8/11, 72.7%), adding that it has improved from the beginning of the epidemic until the moment that the interview was taken. Most of the barriers encountered in the coordination mentioned by respondents were related to communication aspects (47.4%), lack of direct funding to support coordination (15.8%), poor commitment (15.8%), lack of clear chain of command (10.5%) and lack of transparency (10.5%).",
