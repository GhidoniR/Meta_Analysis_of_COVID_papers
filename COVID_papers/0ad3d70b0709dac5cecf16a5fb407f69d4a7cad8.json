The agreement's key value lies in its universality, with broad participation 1 and the same obligation to pledge, report and review for all parties (Victor 2015) . The ambition mechanism enshrined in the agreement relies on a requirement for all parties to voluntarily propose increasingly ambitious nationally determined contributions (NDCs) every five years, as part of a 'pledge and review' governance system (Pickering et al. 2019 ). 2020-21 will likely provide evidence of enhanced ambition as parties are set to report new NDCs in the run-up to the 26th Conference of the Parties in Glasgow.",

To enable the comparison, we develop a conceptual framework for examining two important conditions for achieving the PA's ambitious goals to hold the global average temperature increase to well below 2 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 \u00b0C. First, drawing on the policy mix literature (Jordan and Huitema 2014; Hawlett and del Rio 2015; Kivimaa and Kern 2016; Rogge and Reichardt 2016; Kern et al. 2019) we trace the emergence of broad mixes of reinforcing policies in the three actors, acknowledging that such policy mixes are needed to accelerate a societal transition towards net zero emissions. In the case studies, we focus on 'push' and 'pull' policies for redirecting and accelerating technological change, green industrial policies, policies for just transition, policy feedback from implementation experiences and economic recovery packages. Second, we acknowledge that increased ambition will also depend on the PA's effects on actors' targets, policy mixes and emissions trajectories. Our case studies provide a basis for comparing the actual impact of the PA so far on the three largest emitters.",

While the COVID-19 crisis has-at least temporarily-reduced world GHG emissions by 8% in 2020, low-carbon economic recovery packages are needed to sustain this declining trend. Projections show that even if the transport sector will gradually be wholly electrified and the use of coal will be fully phased out of electricity production and be replaced by renewable energy sources this is not enough to attain the 2 \u00b0C target (Bloomberg 2020; DNVGL 2020) . Our analysis of the biggest emitters aims to build more knowledge about policy ambitions and mixes that may enable an accelerated low-carbon societal transition. In the following sections, we elaborate on the conceptual framework employed in the special feature articles, starting with an introduction to 'green growth' that is the preferred strategy by governments aiming towards net zero emissions.",

According to 'green growth' theory, continued economic growth is compatible with sound environmental stewardship, because technological change and substitution can lead to decoupling of GDP from resource use and carbon emissions (Hickel and Kallis 2019) . This is also underlined by the Impact Population Affluence Technology (IPAT) and Kaya formulas as applied in IPCC assessments (IPCC 2014) . The goal of green growth has now become included in national and international climate policy, also in the Sustainable Development Goals (UN 2020). The European Green Deal explicitly aims to decouple all resource use from economic growth by 2050 (Skjaerseth, this issue).",

Demand-pull policies include the carrot, the stick, and the sermon: binding targets, carbon pricing, subsidies, state-aid rules, technology standards and so on. In the EU for example, various demandside targets and policies are aimed at increasing energy efficiency, promoting renewables, and reducing GHG emissions towards 2030 and beyond. Adequate 'pull' policies may also significantly reduce the risk for private investments in, e.g. large-scale demonstration projects. One example is CCS: it needs 'push' support from basic research, small pilot-and larger demonstration projects to prove its technological potential and bring costs down. However, parallel 'pull' from a sufficiently high carbon price based on taxes or emissions trading will lower the risk of investments for making CCS commercially viable. In general, energy technologies need strong support-from ideas to the mass market-via large-scale demonstration projects, due to the scale of investment, technological and regulatory inertia and fossil fuel lock-in-often leading to the 'valley of death' for low-carbon energy technologies (\u00c5hman et al. 2018 ). Thus, both push and pull policy instruments are necessary; they need to be aligned to drive technology change through various stages of the innovation process. A strong supply-side technology push is deemed particularly important in the earlier, R&D, and demonstration phases of innovations, whereas a strong market pull is considered more important in the later, deployment phase to ensure (full) market introduction.",

It is increasingly recognized that significant change towards a low-carbon economy cannot be achieved with single instruments, but requires a broader mix of reinforcing policies. Recent studies have examined how new combinations of policy instruments shape transition by redirecting and accelerating technological change (Jordan and Huitema 2014; Hawlett and del Rio 2015; Kivimaa and Kern 2016; Rogge and Reichardt 2016) . Combinations of policies are needed not only to support innovation in low-carbon energy sources and systems, but also for more comprehensive sustainability transitions . Achieving this will require broader policies for green industrial growth, including instruments aimed at promoting new 'green' business opportunities and constraining the support for existing polluting industries.

The policy feedback literature provides a starting point for conceptualizing how policies are linked through various policy phases: adoption, implementation, and reform of policies. Since the 1980s, the study of policy feedback has focused on how existing policies affect politics and policy development (B\u00e9land 2010) . Jordan and Matt (2014) define 'policy feedback' as effects flowing from adopted policies on actors' original preferences and the reformed policy in question. This insight has since been expanded to include feedback from policy mixes which may have wider effects-policy mixes affect not only their own development but also other instruments in the same issue-area (Edmondson et al. 2019).",

Implementation of policies for achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement can entail various benefits-like energy security, 'green' jobs, energy technological innovation and alleviation of related problems such as air pollution. For example, reduction of air pollution has been the single most important factor for reducing coal in electricity production in China's (Heggelund, this issue). However, the political, administrative, and economic costs and resources invested in implementation also shape implementation experiences. These may trigger negative policy feedback that undermines reformed policies and reduces the likelihood of meeting the PA target. One example here is energy-intensive industries like steel and aluminium that are based on production processes requiring non-substitutable fossil fuels that are exposed to international competition.",

Structural forces such as path dependency and its self-reinforcing mechanisms are expected to lead to stability (Pierson 2004) . However, exogenous shocks, such as large economic recessions, may be powerful disrupters of such relative stability, providing moments of openness for rapid policy innovation-which may lead to major changes in status quo policies (Kingdon 2003; Capoccia 2015) .
