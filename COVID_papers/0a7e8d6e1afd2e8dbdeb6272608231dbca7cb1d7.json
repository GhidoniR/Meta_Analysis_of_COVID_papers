We hypothesize that having family members or close contacts who were diagnosed with COVID-19 before one's own diagnosis exacerbates illness severity due to several potential mechanisms including changes in available social support access, increased stress and strain, and increased viral load due to the nature of one's exposure to the novel coronavirus. We analyze administrative data of all 417 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Chinese city of Shenzhen between January 8 and February 25, 2020. Our analyses show that, when patients had family members or close ties diagnosed with COVID-19, they experienced more severe illness. We also find that patients with infected family members or close contacts did not have significantly extended total illness duration, due to their reduced time to diagnosis. The implications of both findings are discussed.",

Early in the outbreak when Wuhan, Hubei, was the epicenter of the disease, infections among familial clusters in China and Singapore provided evidence for researchers to confirm person-to-person spread, symptomatic or asymptomatic (Pung et al., 2020; Qian et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020) . As virus hotspots began to appear across the globe, a prevalent pattern in the spread of the virus was the importance of the link between spouses and other family members (Edwards, 2020; Sperling, 2020; Wagner, 2020) . Indeed, the WHO-China Joint Mission noted that family clusters acted as a primary driver of outbreaks in non-Hubei provinces of China (World Health Organization, 2020) .",

An equally fruitful question, we argue, is whether, apart from channeling transmission, the configuration of familial or other close social ties affects COVID-19 severity among existing patients. This is a crucial question to consider, for both pragmatic and theoretical reasons. In order to design more effective clinical interventions, researchers need to identify various potential factors associated with COVID-19 symptom severity. This question is also important from a theoretical standpoint. Research in the sociology of health, social epidemiology, and related fields has established the pervasive influence of social networks on individuals' health outcomes Morris, 2004; Smith & Christakis, 2008; Thoits, 2011; Zhang & Centola, 2019) . These related areas of research demonstrate that the onset, severity, treatment, and resolution of individuals' health problems are influenced by their social network members through a variety of mechanisms (e.g., health-related behaviors).",

We derive two complementary hypotheses that may simultaneously account for severity-related patient outcomes, drawing primarily on network theories of health but also referencing the unique variables likely operative in the pandemic context. To test our hypotheses, we analyze administrative COVID-19 patient data from a major Chinese city that covers all confirmed cases between January 8 and February 25, 2020. Our analysis involves a combination of social network visualization and survival analysis, as well as sensitivity analyses.",

We expand the sociological dialogue around these conditions by arguing that the severity of the resulting COVID-19 disease also has a relational basis, rooted in the nature of the relationships its victims have with each other. Specifically, we argue that there are several mechanisms by which a person's social connection to another infected individual can modulate the severity of one's COVID-19 illness. In the following sections, we explain our rationale by examining some of these potential mechanisms.",

The pathways through which social ties affect health are multifaceted, ranging from indirect psychological mechanisms such as the creation of a sense of mattering or belonging, companionship and selfesteem, to direct network influences on health behavior such as social influence, social comparison, and social control (Thoits, 2011) .",

In the case of COVID-19 symptom severity, it is possible that these negative effects are amplified. Intrafamilial infection implies the simultaneous illness of the individual and their close tie, and thus the loss of avenue for instrumental and expressive support on both sides. Specifically, as one family member begins to show symptoms of COVID-19, another family may start serving the role of a primary caregiver by providing informal health care and taking up more household chores. In situations of intrafamilial infection, the family caregiver may also have contracted the virus. On one hand, apart from lacking access to care and support for themselves, the infected caregiver may experience enhanced caregiver burden (Dunkin & Anderson-Hanley, 1998) , underplay the symptoms they experience to fulfill their caregiving role, or prioritize the health of the care recipient over their own-all of which can lead to the more rapid progression of illness. On the other hand, the illness severity of the care recipient may be directly aggravated once the caregiving family member falls ill, as the health of care recipients tends to heavily depend on the health of the caregiver due to the support and assistance the latter provides for the former (Dunkin & Anderson-Hanley, 1998; Schulz & Beach, 1999) .",

This is a concern that is immediately relevant to families living in the same household, although it could also apply to family members living apart who regularly provide care for each other (e.g., divorced parents who share custody of children, adult couples who live near their senior parents). Specifically, on the onset of symptoms in the first patient of a family, it is possible that other members give much of their support to this patient, making it more difficult to expend enough resources on those who are diagnosed later. On a broader level, home quarantine as a general practice during the pandemic presents unprecedented challenges for family households, due to inadequate space for social distancing, taxing family duties, limited care resources, and financial constraints (Hado & Feinberg, 2020; Mohile et al., 2020; Stokes & Patterson, 2020; Usher et al., 2020) .

Additionally, research in neuroimmunology has documented a clear link between stress and the immune systems. Stressors lasting only for minutes may trigger reactions in specific functions of the immune systems, whereas major stress-inducing life events (e.g., bereavement, cancer) can seriously disrupt individuals' immune responses (Reiche et al., 2004; Segerstrom & Miller, 2004) .",

There are several reasons to expect a relationship between the infection of a family member or close tie and illness severity. Individuals who have family members or other close ties who are infected with the virus may encounter higher viral loads because they have more frequent and sustained interactions with infected people. This is likely to occur not only because of the greater likelihood of repeated and sustained exposure to infected contacts (e.g., via extended conversations) but also because of the more intimate nature of those exposures which can involve substantial exposure to respiratory droplets (e.g., via hugging, kissing, laughing, and yelling). Moreover, close contacts likely have multiple exposures to each other's illness, including the direct exposures just described but also indirect exposure via contact with multiple contaminated surfaces (e.g., doorknobs, countertops, and other commonly shared household items).",

The Cox model predicts the \"hazard\" of the subject experiencing an event (i.e., the probability of experiencing an event at an instantaneous time point, conditional on the subject's not having yet experienced the event). Here, our events of interest are hospital discharge or receiving a diagnosis, and greater hazards in the estimated models correspond to shorter durations leading up to the event. A hazard ratio of larger than 1 indicates that a predictor in question increases the hazard or rate of the event occurring, or equivalently, that it decreases the duration needed for the event to occur; alternatively, a hazard ratio of 1 means no effect. For bivariate analysis, we conduct log-rank tests, univariate Cox regression as well as Kaplan-Meier curve analysis. Log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier curve are common nonparametric survival analysis techniques for examining observed differences in hazards between groups, and we dichotomize our network predictors (i.e., 0 vs. 1+ contacts) for these analyses to allow for cross-group comparisons. To incorporate time-varying covariates, we prepare our data in long form for analysis of multiple observations per subject.

These models show significantly enhanced rates of diagnosis for patients with close ties to other patients (p < .001). Controlling for other variables, each additional close contact (Model 3) or core family member (Model 4) who is also diagnosed with COVID-19 multiplies one's rate of receiving a diagnosis by 5.19 and 4.36, respectively. Additionally, the source of virus exposure (Model 3) and the number of city-level active cases (Models 3 and 4) also emerge as significant predictors of the rate of diagnosis. Compared with patients whose source of exposure was contact with local Shenzhen cases, Model 3 shows that patients who had a history of travel to Hubei (p < .01, confidence interval [CI: 1.52, 6.16]) and those who had prior contact with Wuhan cases (p < .05, CI [1.21, 6.02]) have significantly higher rates of being diagnosed.

Juxtaposing Models 5 and 7, respectively, against Models 6 and 8, the coefficients for network predictors are consistently significant in Models 6 and 8 where TTD is included as a control variable (p < .05). On the other hand, without TTD as a control, Model 5 (p = .099) and Model 7 (p = .113) show no relationship at the 0.05 level between the rate of recovery and the number of infected close contacts or core family members. All four models suggest a prolonged LI if a patient has more close contacts or core family members who are also diagnosed with COVID-19, but the effect sizes are larger after TTD is controlled for. For example, Model 8 predicts a 23% (= 1 \u2212 0.77) decrease in the rate of recovery with each additional core family member being infected, whereas the corresponding figure is 18% according to Model 7. Note. This table uses multivariate Cox analyses to investigate whether the number of infected close ties or core family members is associated with patients' length of hospital stay (LOS) and time to diagnosis (TTD). We juxtapose results for these two outcomes because of our hypotheses that illness severity is exacerbated by the infection of family members or close ties, but the progression of the disease can be alleviated by the quickened diagnosis among those with familial or close ties to other patients. The models in Table 2 provide evidence for these hypotheses, after controlling for possible confounders. The hazard of hospital discharge significantly decreases, with the presence of infected close contacts or infected core family members, in contrast to the significantly increased rates of diagnosis. In particular, Models 1 and 2 estimate that the extension in hospital stay due to intrafamilial or close tie infection is comparable to, and indeed slightly larger than that caused by a 10-year increase in age.

One may suspect that early diagnosis artificially inflates LOS regardless of illness severity, given that the Shenzhen authorities hospitalize all patients who test positive. In particular, in the absence of effective antiviral treatment capable of shortening the duration of COVID-19, early diagnosis could be a chief factor accounting for longer LOS. We conduct two sensitivity analyses in response to this concern (Table 5) . First, we rerun LOS-related Cox models, adding TTD as a control variable (Models S1 and S2). Second, we run a logistic regression predicting whether a case is marked as severe or critical during their hospitalization (Models S3 and S4), using the Firth algorithm to account for the rarity of these cases (Wang, 2014) . In both analyses, we again observe a positive association between severity and close ties' infections. Models S1 and S2 for LOS show delayed hospital discharge for higher counts of infected close contacts (p < .05, CI [.64, .94 ]) or core family members (p < .05, CI [.59, .97 ]), with no effect of TTD on LOS (p = .80 for Model S1, p = .84 for Model S2). Similarly, logistic regressions in Models S3 and S4 indicate that the odds of being a severe or critical case multiply by 1.92 or 2.5 with each additional infected close contact (p < .05) or core family members (p < .10), but are unaffected by the rate of diagnosis (p = .86 for Model S3, p = 0.71 for Model S4). Additionally, the logit models identify city-level case count at the time of a patient's diagnosis as a negative predictor of case severity (p < .01).",

Combined, these two forces counteract each other, resulting in no overall significant association between patients' total LI and betweenpatient ties. These results have important implications for public health interventions. First, adding to previously reported risk factors-such as older age, being male, certain clinical conditions, obesity, and non-White ethnicity (Esai Selvan, 2020; Tian et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020 )-we find that having close social connectedness to other patients may be another risk factor for severe COVID-19. The predictive power of this factor is visible across all Cox and logistic models, with effect sizes consistently comparable to, and oftentimes exceeding, that of being 10 years senior in age. As for clinical practice, this finding calls for the active screening of, as well as extra care to, patients who may have family members or loved ones also testing positive, as these individuals can be more vulnerable to severe symptoms.",

Nonetheless, our substantive conclusions are unlikely to be refuted by the censoring of undetected cases. To the extent that contact tracing is facilitated among closely related people as opposed to among distant contacts or strangers, undetected cases are more likely to be isolates in our study (i.e., patients who do not have close ties or family members diagnosed).

More generally, data with more detailed demographic variables such as co-residency, the type of dwelling, marital status, and socioeconomic status would allow researchers to further unveil the dynamics and consequences of intrafamilial transmission. Finally, we model our network predictors as time-varying covariates to mitigate reverse causation, but as in any study with nonexperimental data, endogeneity can still be an issue. For example, our time-dependent modeling strategy precludes cases where one patient develops more severe symptoms before or after the hospital discharge of their diagnosed family member, but ambiguities in time sequence could remain, due to reasons like varying incubation periods between family members, as well as the fact that one can presumably get the illness twice.",

For example, this study treated familial and close ties as an explanatory variable, but intrafamilial infection also deserves attention as an explanandum. It is worth exploring whether certain characteristics of an individual's personal network predispose them to a higher likelihood of clustered infections, and whether such network features disproportionately appear within specific sociodemographic groups. Also, although our main finding supports the idea that close ties to other COVID-19 patients exacerbates illness severity, we cannot actually observe the underlying social mechanisms. We encourage future researchers, especially those with more fine-grained data, to explore these processes. Research effort in these directions, we believe, will shed important light on the undoubtedly numerous, but yet unknown, social determinants and consequences of COVID-19.",
