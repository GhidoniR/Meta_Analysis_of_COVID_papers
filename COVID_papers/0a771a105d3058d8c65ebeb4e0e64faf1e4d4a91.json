The cohort was followed from 2 January 2019/2020 until death or 16/15 October 2019/2020. The cohort comprised 340 392 and 347 136 patients with cardiovascular disease in 2019 and 2020, respectively.

Compared with many other countries, the rates of laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths have been low in Denmark. 2 Thus, as of 16 October 2020, Denmark, with a population of 5.8 million people, had a total of 35 291 cases and 679 deaths. 2, 3 However, these mitigation strategies, which were implemented in Denmark on 13 March 2020, may have a detrimental effect on medical care of other and more prevalent medical conditions and may, for example, affect optimal treatment delivery to patients with acute or established cardiovascular diseases. Another consequence may also be that some individuals experiencing symptoms suggestive of acute cardiovascular conditions or clinical deterioration in established cardiovascular diseases may be more likely to stay at home, and perhaps seek alternative care, rather than attending emergency departments due to fear of acquiring COVID- 19. 4-16 While the detrimental impact of these widespread strategies has been suggested, longitudinal data in patients with established cardiovascular disease are lacking. Specifically, whether, and to what extent, a lockdown strategy and reorganization of the healthcare system, as well as the pandemic itself, have impacted mortality rates and location of death in patients with established cardiovascular diseases has not been examined. Given that established cardiovascular diseases constitute a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality 17, 18 and necessitate optimal medical care and regular evaluation, such knowledge is of great importance and will shed light on another possible collateral effect of a lockdown strategy and reorganization of the healthcare system.",

On 6 April, the Danish authorities announced that the government would commence a gradual and controlled reopening of Danish society. The first phase of reopening of Danish society included reopening of schools for younger pupils (15 April) and liberal professions (20 April). 19 The second phase included reopening of restaurants and cafes (18 May), schools for older pupils (18 May), cultural and recreational activities (i.e. museums, theatres, and outdoor parks), and research institutions (27 May). 19 The third phase included an easing of the ban of gatherings to 50 people (8 June) and allowed all public sector employees to return to work in person (15 June). 19 ",

For example, several countries, including the USA, Italy, France, Austria, and Denmark, have observed a substantial decline in hospital admissions for acute cardiovascular diseases, such as acute coronary syndrome, stroke, new-onset atrial fibrillation, and decompensated heart failure, and a considerable proportion of excess deaths not attributed to COVID-19 during the ongoing pandemic. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] 30, 31 There has also been concern that the societal lockdown and reorganization of healthcare systems with reduced routine care may confer an increase in deaths not due to COVID-19 in patients with established cardiovascular diseases. However, whether the potential collateral effects of the COVID-19 lockdown may extend to patients with established cardiovascular diseases has not been investigated. In our nationwide study, we did not observe an increased mortality rate in patients with established cardiovascular diseases during lockdown and reopening of Danish society compared with the same period in the preceding year, and this finding was consistent across all subgroups of established cardiovascular diseases. This finding is also in keeping with a previous study, in which we found that the overall mortality rate in the general population during weeks 1-27 in 2020 was not higher than the mortality rates in the same period in 2015-2019 in Denmark. 32 However, this is in contrast to the findings from many other countries. 30, 31 Although we can only speculate on this finding, it is possible that the implementation of timely, and comprehensive, lockdown measures and subsequent low burden of COVID-19 may in part explain the absence of excess mortality in the general population as well as in patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases. While our findings apparently do not suggest any collateral effects of the lockdown strategy on the care of patients with cardiovascular diseases, further data are needed to establish the long-term impact on the prognosis in these patients.",

While the overall mortality rate in patients with established cardiovascular diseases during lockdown and reopening of Danish society was not different from that of the preceding year, a decrease in the rate of in-hospital mortality and a corresponding increase in the rate of out-of-hospital mortality was observed compared with the same period in 2019. This difference in location of death was evident across all subgroups of established cardiovascular diseases, particularly heart failure. It is therefore important to try to better understand why the overall mortality rate was similar during lockdown compared with the same period in the preceding year despite a substantial change in location of death. It may reflect an increased reluctance of patients with established cardiovascular diseases, particularly those with terminal illness and end-stage disease, to contact emergency medical services and seek medical care due to the message from governments worldwide to stay at home, the fear of acquiring COVID-19 in hospital, or perhaps to avoid adding to an overburdened healthcare system. As patients with established cardiovascular disease are more susceptible to becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 and have a higher case-fatality rate compared with COVID-19 patients without cardiovascular disease, [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] these patients are likely to be even more reluctant to contact emergency medical services and to seek medical care. This is in line with recent studies which suggest that the number of hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases in general have decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] An interesting observation was that the incidence rate for out-of-hospital mortality seemed to increase before the implementation of lockdown measures (i.e. from week 8 in 2020 compared with 2019). This finding further supports the notion that the observed changes in mortality patterns are not due to lockdown measures alone, but also reflect an increased reluctance towards seeking medical care due to the message from governments worldwide to stay at home or the fear of acquiring COVID-19 in hospital. What are the potential implications of our findings? We believe that our findings suggest that the message from governments worldwide to stay at home should be more nuanced and reinforce the necessity of a clear public health message to patients experiencing symptoms suggestive of acute cardiovascular conditions or clinical deterioration in established cardiovascular diseases to still seek emergency medical services rather than to stay at home or seek alternative care. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to clarify the causes of such changes.",

The explanations for this observation are not clear and we can only speculate on this finding. However, a substantial decrease in the number of cases with a positive test for influenza in Denmark was observed in the 2020 season compared with the 2019 season (7575 vs. 11 645 positive cases in Denmark, with a population of 5.8 million people) 43 and it is possible that this may, in part, contribute to the observed lower mortality rate in 2020 compared with 2019.",

The Danish healthcare system, funded by taxes, provides equal access to healthcare services for all residents regardless of socioeconomic or insurance status. The findings of this study, however, should be viewed in the context of a number of limitations. The observational nature precludes the assessment of causal inference. Thus, we report associations and not cause-effect relationships. Likewise, the possibility of residual confounding cannot be excluded despite adjustment for potential confounders. Data on important clinical parameters, such as cardiovascular disease severity, symptoms, and laboratory (e.g. estimated glomerular fraction and natriuretic peptides) and echocardiographic measurements, and utilization of visiting nurse services or palliative care initiatives were not available. Likewise, data on COVID-19 status among patients who died were not available. However, the burden of COVID-19 was relatively small in Denmark compared with other European countries and the USA. In Denmark, deaths must be registered within 2 weeks after their occurrence. However, we addressed this potential issue by terminating follow-up on 15 October 2020, despite the fact that data on mortality were available until Mid November 2020. In addition, data on cause of death were not available for this study as the Danish Registry of Causes of Death is currently updated until the end of 2018. Finally, the impact of the societal lockdown and healthcare system Cardiovascular disease, mortality, and location of death during the COVID-19 pandemic reorganization in Denmark with 5.8 million citizens, a universal healthcare system, and high socioeconomic status may not be generalizable to larger countries with less uniform healthcare systems and low socioeconomic status.",
