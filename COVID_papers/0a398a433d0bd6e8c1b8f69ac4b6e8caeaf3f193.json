During the COVID-19 downturn and the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), stock returns were largely affected by a change in the long-run implied growth rate and only to a lesser extent by a change in discount rate, the latter typically used to explain stock returns in the classical asset pricing literature. We reach this conclusion by using ordinary least-squares (OLS) regressions of stock returns on the unobservable Gordon factors, which we estimate from firm-level valuation ratios D/P, P/E, and P/B. The effects from a decrease in implied growth outweigh those from an increase in discount rate by a factor of approximately 1.6 to 1.7. Also, firms with a decrease in implied growth show a stock return that is approximately 6.6% more negative than that of firms with no decrease in implied growth. Investors can infer valuable information from the joint interpretation of underlying market fundamentals as derived from the Gordon model.",

From the beginning of March 2009 through February 19, 2020, the S&P index rose approximately 400% in current dollars. In the following four weeks, it declined sharply by almost 34% by March 23, 2020, induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. In a subsequent V-shaped market recovery, the S&P500 gained back 59% of that loss in a few weeks until April 30, 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a massive spike in uncertainty, challenging policymakers and investors likewise in finding accurate responses to a crisis that has unfolded with extreme speed. Given the high level of uncertainty, the question arises whether the stock market downturn can be explained by transitory shocks to discount rates as opposed to long-term or permanent shocks related to expected dividend growth.",

Compared to other more demanding econometric models, our approach is considerably simpler. Instead of historical returns, we use forward-looking fundamentals to derive the Gordon factors as predictors of returns in the cross section of S&P500 constituents. Specifically, the Gordon valuation model provides two essential return predictors, namely innovations in discount and growth rates, in an economically meaningful and direct way without snooping around in a factor zoo. This is in line with the claim of Harvey (2017) that theoretical priors, here based on a simple valuation model, and economic plausibility must be part of the inference drawn from empirical tests in asset pricing. Moreover our approach is economically intuitive and helps practitioners to assess the valuation of stock markets, namely to answer the question whether the market downturn can be explained by transitory discount rate shocks as opposed to long-term or permanent growth rate shocks.",

(2013) show, stock market downturns may have different proximate causes but are largely driven by two factors: the discount rate applied to profits by rational investors and the expected growth of future profits. In other words, these two factors may complement each other in the price discovery process. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one study that investigates the current crisis and its impact on stock prices addressing these joint determinants, discount rate and expected growth. Gormsen and Koijen (2020) use a dividend growth model and dividend futures (strips) to quantify how investors' expectations about economic growth evolve in response to the crisis and find a lower bound on the change in expected dividends of \u2212 45% at the two-year horizon. They use the term structure of dividend futures as a forward-looking measure of the expected path of the economy.",

In contrast, a change in discount rate k is associated with a temporary shock to stock prices. This shock resulting from a possible positive shock to expected returns that is at some point compensated by higher realized returns-which outweighs the short run effect. Price changes following a discount rate shock are likely to mean revert.

For various markets (stocks, bonds, debt, and housing markets, for example), a valuation ratio (such as the dividend-price ratio for stocks, the bond yield, price/rent ratios for the housing markets, etc.) is used to estimate near-term expected excess returns. For example, the predictive regression equation R t+k = \u03b1 + \u03b2(D t /P t ) + \u03b5 t+k , where the dependent variable is some return less a risk-free rate and D t /P t is the observed dividend-price ratio, is typically used to forecast stock returns. This standard regression does, however, not account for any changes in implied long-term growth, which, as we will show, may affect stock prices considerably. For instance, in the Fama and French (2002) study on the equity premium in the second half of the twentieth century, the authors conclude that the high average returns over the observed period are mainly driven by declining expected returns, extracted, e.g., from the D/P-ratio, so that the average returns are largely interpreted as unexpected. In our view, this conclusion is only valid if the expected growth rate shows no variation.

Panel A of Table 1 shows the frequency and relative/cumulative weight of firm observations per industry represented in the S&P500 index. As we can see, our sample eliminations left the distribution of firms across industries almost unchanged, leading us to the conclusion that our sample remains representative of the S&P500 index. The figures in panel B of Table 1 reveal that the mean loss across the stocks from February 19, 2020 to March 23, 2020 is 38.1%. The total return for the period February 19 through April 30, 2020, is \u2212 18.6%. The mean return for the recovery period (March 23 through April 30, 2020) is 21.9%. This corresponds to a percentage recovery of 43.3%. The average (median) ex ante P/E-ratio as of end-December 2019 is 20.45 (18.52), which compares to the same ex post figure as of end-April 2020 of 18.9 (16.6) which represents only a moderate decline given the sharp decrease of stock prices in this period. A sharper decrease can be observed for the ratio between the market and book value, the P/B ratio, which drops from an average (median) of 5.0 to 4.3 (3.2 to 2.5). The dividend-price ratio D/P increases from an average (median) of 1.9% to 2.3% (1.8% to 2.1%) in this period, simply suggesting that the downward revisions of stock prices were larger than those of the forward-looking dividend per share. While it is not surprising that the cross-sectional standard deviation of the valuation measures remains stable (P/E: 10.0 vs. 10.0) or increases, P/B: 5.9 to 6.8, D/P: 1.4 to 1.7) during the market turmoil, it is surprising how little the changes are, given that firm-level data are analyzed.

Overall, the relative change in implied growth w (\u2212 12%) exceeds this value by a factor of approximately 1.4. To be able to interpret the decline in the discount rate, one has to separate the risk-free rate from the expected risk premium. Since the Gordon model assumes a very long (infinite) future time horizon, the interest rate implicit in longmaturity government bonds is used. The 10-year constant maturity US Treasury rate declined from 1.92 to 0.64% over the relevant measurement interval. This implies a decrease of the median expected risk premium from 12.48% (14.4%-1.92%) to 12.09% (12.7%-0.64%), i.e. by 0.39%. Thus, most of the decline in the discount rate can be attributed to the interest component. A positive association between parallel shifts in interest rates and expected risk premiums contradicts, however, several empirical findings. For example, Duarte and Rosa (2015) find the high-equity risk premium in the post-GFC period has been the result of the extremely low risk-free rate.",

While this interpretation seems to be valid for short investment horizons measured over typical stock market cycles, the discount rate in the Gordon model refers, in principle, to an infinite time horizon and, therefore, requires a distinct interpretation which is related to the long-run risk (LRR) literature and focuses on growth risk. Bansal and Yaron (2004) and Bansal (2007) have developed classical models in which news about growth rates and economic uncertainty affect asset prices. An intuitive explanation can, however, be derived from the Gordon model itself and the assumption of dividend smoothing. Concerned with dividend stability, managers do not adjust dividends immediately in downturns, leading to an increase in D/P. In the Gordon formula, this type of dividend smoothing implies a pro-cyclical behavior of growth risk as can be seen from where the denominator, k \u2212 w, is equal to the D/P ratio. The expression displays the sensitivity of the relative changes of stock prices with respect to small changes in the implied growth rate. In a market downturn, the D/P ratio increases which lowers the sensitivity. Hence, growth risk decreases in market downturns. Does it also lead to a decline in the growth risk premium? A key insight of the LRR pricing models by Bansal and Yaron (2004) etc. is that a positive growth risk premium requires a representative investor having a preference for early-as opposed to late-resolution of uncertainty. The evidence presented in panel C of Table 1 suggests that, indeed, the implied expected risk premium declines in times when the expected growth rate declines as well. At first glance counterintuitive, the observed decrease in k appears to adhere to the Gordon model, dividend smoothing, and the pricing of growth risk in the LRR asset pricing literature.",

Beta weights make it easier to compare the economic effects of the explanatory variables across models; they reveal how much of a standard deviation the stock return R changes for each standard deviation shift in an explanatory variable, here the Gordon factors. We conduct our analysis for both the market downturn scenario and the recovery scenario. (3) show the result of simple ordinary least-squares (OLS) regressions of stock returns on the change in discount rate, \u0394k, implied growth, \u0394w, and the payout ratio, \u03941-b over the period starting December 31, 2019 and ending April 30, 2020. Columns (4) and (5) show the results using multiple OLS. Robust normalized beta coefficients are shown in parenthesis. These indicate the effect size of the Gordon factors and tell how much of a standard deviation in stock returns change for each standard deviation change in the Gordon factors. We use industry categorical variables to account for industry fixed effects. The communication services industry is used as the base and the factor results and beta weights for industries are shown as differences to this base Significance is denoted by ***p < 0.01, **p < 0.05, *p < 0.1 (1) through (3), only a change in implied growth, \u0394w, appears to affect stock returns, statistically only marginally significant though. A change in discount rate k, \u0394k, and in payout ratio, \u03941 \u2212 b, do not affect stock returns in a significant way; k has moreover the wrong sign. It is only when we augment the specifications as in columns (4) and (5) to multiple OLS regressions that our Gordon factors become statistically significant at the 1% level. Second, the coefficients of \u0394k and \u0394w show an almost perfect mirror image in terms of effect size. As expected from the model predictions, an increase in the discount rate k is negatively related to stock returns R i , i.e., the coefficient exhibits a negative sign. Likewise, an increase in implied growth is positively related to stock returns, i.e., the coefficient exhibits a positive sign. Third, we note that the effect sizes of \u0394k and \u0394w are large. A one standard deviation change in these variables according to specification (4) impacts stock returns by an important approximate \u00b1 (1.85 \u00d7 13.7%) = 25.3%. For example, a 1% increase in k (decrease in w) has an impact on stock returns in the magnitude of \u2212 4.2% (+ 4.2%). 3 Fourth, the effect size of \u0394k and \u0394w is remarkably higher than industry affiliation. For example, as shown in column (5), the industry with the largest beta weight (\u2212 0.44) is consumer discretionary, significant at the 1% level, with a beta weight approximately one fifth the size of that of \u0394k or \u0394w. In other words, changes in the Gordon factors affect stock returns more than any industry affiliation by our sample. Finally, we find that the adjusted R 2 s in specifications (4) and (5) in the magnitude of 32% are surprisingly large for firm-level returns.",

            "text": "It is apparent from the specifications in columns (4) to (5) that the estimated Gordon parameters are very large when jointly included in the estimated equation compared to the specifications in (1) to (3). The explanation is in the high correlation between \u0394k and \u0394w which is close to one in the cross section of firms. However, this is the result of the Gordon model filtering out the joint explanatory effect of the implied fundamentals. The high multicollinearity has no technical reason but rather reflects that the change in the dividend yield of the stocks is highly cross sectionally correlated. This is displayed in Fig. 2 , which shows the ex ante and ex post D/P-ratio with a correlation of 0.94. If the Gordon model is valid, it follows from equation [2] that the difference \u0394k \u2212 \u0394w is equal to the change of the dividend yield, \u0394(D\u2215P) . Apparently, the Gordon model captures the actual change in the D/P ratio very well, which explains the high correlation between \u0394k and \u0394w. 4 In a next step, we evaluate whether the negative returns for firms with a decrease in implied growth w (increase in discount rate k) are in fact larger than for firms with no such decrease (increase). We verify our findings from Table 2 using a two tailed t test and the Wilcoxon's ranksum test. We apply a dummy variable taking the value of one if w (k) decreases (increases) by the Gordon formula, zero otherwise, to the two groups of firms. The results are shown in Table 3 , panel A. The t test (405) = 4.74, p < 0.001 reveals that 114 firms without a negative change in implied growth exhibit an average return of \u2212 33.3%, which is significantly different from the negative average return of \u2212 40.0% of those 291 firms that experience a decrease in implied growth. The statistical significance of this difference is also confirmed by the rank sum test with z = 4.76, p < 0.001. Therefore, firms with a decrease in implied growth w show a stock return that is 6.6% more negative than that of firms with no decrease in implied growth w.",

This significant difference in return in the amount of 5.1% is confirmed by the rank sum test with z = \u2212 3.51, p < 0.001. Albeit counterintuitive, we rationalize this result by the fact that the decrease in implied growth w outweighs the effects from an increase in discount rate k. Overall, our results from OLS regressions as well as our tests of the difference in means lend support to the predicted effects from the Gordon model. Looking at our cross-sectional changes in the implied Gordon parameters, primarily k and w, during the COVID-19 crisis (see Table 1 ), the relative cross-sectional decrease in implied growth (\u0394w = \u2212 8.3%) is larger than the relative change of the discount rate (\u0394k = \u2212 5.1%), by a factor of approximately 1.6. Moreover, the discount rate k decreases, in line with the predictions of LRR-models, while the traditional asset pricing literature would presume an increase of discount rates during a crisis.",

The interpretation of changes in P/E or D/P are, however, not simple. A decrease in P/E may simply be the result of falling stock prices in the downturn, and changes in the D/P may reflect stock returns that are more negative than forward-looking dividends per share. For example, a variation in D/P may be due to irrational bubbles in stock prices. In this case, the dividend-price ratios (and expected returns) are high when stock prices are temporarily irrationally low (and vice versa). This implies that we cannot infer much information from these coefficients.

For example, in the empirical asset pricing literature, an increase in the D/P ratio is typically read as an increase in expected returns. If so, why would then a higher D/P-ratio in the cross-section be negatively related to stock returns, as in column (3)? Fourth, the model fit of specifications (1) through (7) is approximately comparable and around 30%. Against this background, it is hard to understand why one should infer information from firm-specific valuation ratios, which may lead to spurious conclusions, rather than their joint interpretation with respect to the underlying market fundamentals as derived from the Gordon model. The Gordon factors, which can be estimated from the three widely used Table 5 Valuation versus Gordon factors   This table shows (7) the results of OLS regressions of stock returns on positive changes in discount rate, +\u0394k, implied growth, +\u0394w, and the payout ratio, +\u03941 \u2212 b, all changes measured over the period starting Variables (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) Table 5 , which describes the same factors and their effect on stock returns R i in the extended downmarket including the V-shaped recovery after the market low on March 23, 2020. Like before, an increase in D/P is negatively related to stock returns, which is intuitively not what we would expect from traditional asset pricing models (column 3). Albeit their significance, classical valuation ratios are difficult to interpret when using them to estimate stock returns. As before, using valuation factors P/E, P/B, and D/P in columns (1) through (3) renders approximately the same model fit as using the Gordon factors (column 7), the latter now significant at the 1% level (+ \u0394w) and the 5% level (+ \u0394k) and-as stressed before-much more informative than the valuation ratios.

However, we also find confirming results for many other industries with significant coefficients and an adjusted R 2 ranging from approximately 21% in the lowest (materials, extended downmarket) to 72% in the highest case (consumer staples, extended downmarket).

The stock market downturn during the GFC is researched by Campbell et al. (2013) , who use a vector autoregressive (VAR) model to estimate the effects from an increase in discount rates as opposed to a decrease in rational expectations of future profits, and find that stock market downturns were primarily driven by the latter. Can we reach the same conclusion by using the much simpler Gordon model? First, we compare the valuation ratios to the estimated Gordon parameters for this period. Second, we rerun a set of OLS regressions and finally, we provide an out-ofsample estimation based on the coefficients of our main analysis. Table 7 shows the descriptive statistics for the GFC, including valuation ratios in panel A and estimated Gordon factors in panel B. The stock return for the GFC period is \u2212 35.02%, comparable in magnitude to the \u2212 37.25% return for the COVID-19 period. A striking observation is the difference between the levels of the P/E and P/B ratios, which are considerably lower for the GFC (as opposed to the COVID-19 crisis). On average, the P/E (P/B) ratio prior to the GFC amounts to 13.7 (2.8), which compares to the same ratios prior to the COVID-19 crisis of 21.2 and 5.0. As expected, the forward-looking multiples declined after the onset of the market downturn. The P/E (P/B) ratio falls from 13.7 to 11.7 by approximately 2.0 or \u2212 14.7% (2.8 to 1.9 by 0.9 or \u2212 32.7%).

These indicate the effect size of the Gordon factors and tell how much of a standard deviation in stock returns change for each standard deviation change in the Gordon factors. We use industry categorical variables to account for industry fixed effects. The communication services industry is used as the base and the factor results and beta weights for industries are shown as differences to this base Significance is denoted by ***p<0.01, **p<0.05, *p<0. recovery, we find that stock returns are largely affected by a change in the implied growth rate w and only to a lesser extent by a change in discount rate k, the latter typically used to explain stock returns in the classical asset pricing literature. The effects from a decrease in implied growth outweigh those from an increase in discount rate by a factor of approximately 1.7, implying the COVID-19 stock market downturn is of long term rather than transitory character. We also find that firms with a decrease in implied growth w show a stock return that is approximately 6.6% more negative than that of firms with no decrease in implied growth. We also evaluate the performance of the Gordon factors in an extended downmarket period including the V-shaped recovery as well as for the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and find strong support for our observations.",
