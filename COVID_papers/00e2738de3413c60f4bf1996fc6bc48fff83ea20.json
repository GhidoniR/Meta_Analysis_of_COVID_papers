Our model dynamics is expressed by a single prognostic variable which satisfies an integro-differential equation. All unknown parameters are described with a single, timedependent variable R(t). We show that our model has similarities to classic compartmental models, such as SIR, and that the variable R(t) can be interpreted as a generalized effective reproduction number. The advantages of our approach are the simplicity of having only one equation, the numerical stability due to an integral formulation and the reliability since the model is formulated in terms of the most trustable statistical data variable: the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases of COVID-19. Once this dynamic variable is calculated, other non-dynamic variables, such as the number of heavy cases (hospital beds), the number of intensive-care cases (ICUs) and the fatalities, can be derived from it using a similarly stable, integral approach. The formulation with a single equation allows us to calculate from real data the values of the sample effective reproduction number, which can then be fitted. Extrapolated values of R(t) can be used in the model to make reliable forecasts, though under the assumption that measures for reducing infections are maintained. We have applied our model to more than 15 countries and the ongoing results are available on a web-based platform [1]. In this paper, we focus on the data for two exemplary countries, Italy and Germany, and show that the model is capable of reproducing the course of the epidemic in the past and forecasting its course for a period of four to five weeks with a reasonable numerical stability.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Our primary aim is to set up a deterministic model that can be easily tuned with available data in order to make numerically stable forecasts.

This is true if the number of daily new cases P (t) ( with respect to t) can be described by a Gaussian distribution. As we will show, a symmetric distribution function P (t) corresponds to an effective reproduction number that converges rapidly to zero. This might be true for China data. In Italy and Germany we observed a final (at the time of writing) value for R eff between 0.6 to 0.8, leading to an asymmetric function P (t) with a long tail. Although the peak date has been predicted well in [2] , the predicted total cases and fatalities differ by more than 30%. Current deterministic models were developed with the aim of simulating possible scenarios and showing the effect of containment and mitigation measurements.

Therefore, symptom-based screenings, which are the most frequent epidemiologic investigations adopted in many countries, are likely to miss a lot of them (see [13] and references therein). Though the diagnosed cases are only a fraction of the total cases, what is important is that the proportion of asymptomatic cases be nearly constant over time (in this regard, see also the interesting simulation study reported in Web Appendix 8 of [9] ). One of the main objectives of an epidemiological analysis is to give estimates of the reproduction number R after restrictive measures (e.g., confinement, social distancing) have been adopted to limit epidemic spreading. With such constraints, assuming constant environment and exponential increase in new case counts appears unjustified [14] and a more empirical data-based approach is more appropriate to follow the temporal evolution of the reproducing number.

This behaviour of the data was also noted in [15] , especially for what concerns fatalities. Since the steps in R n are strongly smeared out, we simply model data by one single step with an asymptotic decay. Obviously, in order to gain higher accuracy, R(t) could be described with a more complicated, piece-wise defined function but at the price of introducing additional fitting parameters. The time T Q can be read rather easily from the course of the data and set approximately as the time when R n starts decreasing.

All these characteristics can be captured with a suitable choice of the summation weights g i . The weights g i are samples of an infectivity probability (see, e.g., Fig. 2 ) over the time period of N r days in the past (i.e., t \u2264 0) that we have assumed to be Gamma-distributed with shape p and rate b.

Assuming that the infectiousness of a single individual is Gamma-distributed, the infectiousness of the sum of all individuals is again Gamma-distributed and therefore also the average infectiousness used in our deterministic model has this characteristic distribution.

First of all, our approach does not explicitly model S(t) with a coupled prognostic equation. This sounds reasonable to us because the assumption that susceptible individuals are removed only by the infection process is wrong for the current COVID-19 epidemic. In fact, severe quarantine measures, including lockdowns and social distancing, have been implemented in almost all countries. 2. Other compartmental models take such measures into account by introducing, e.g., direct transfers from S to r compartments. However, in our opinion, this makes these models complicated and hides the fact that political measures and their effects are extremely difficult to model. Our approach is a very practical one: we do not model S(t). We focus on R(t), which we have seen being related to the product of the basic reproduction number R 0 and the time-dependent relative susceptible number s(t). We extract R(t) from real data using our model assumptions and apply a curve fitting procedure to allow for extrapolation. Therefore, our approach can be called \"hybrid\": a mixture of curve fitting and modelling. 3. By using the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases P(t) as prognostic variable, we automatically have the numbers of new infections as \u0394P n . In our opinion, this is the best variable to describe how the epidemic evolves. In SIR models, this number is not automatically obtained since I represents the \"currently infected people\" and \u0394I is a net difference mixing the \"new positive cases\", that is, the transfer from S to I , with the \"removed cases\", i.e., the transfer from I to r . 4. By introducing the weights g i we can model the incubation time, namely, the time between \"getting infected\" and \"being infectious\", as well as the time before detection. 5. We define the removed people r (t), which counts the individuals that no longer take part in the infection process, as all positive cases P(t \u2212 T r ) at a certain previous time T r . Again, we have no prognostic equation for r (t). Therefore, we do not have to model and elaborate how these individuals are removed from the infection process. We simply assume they are removed after a certain time T r because, prior to curing or deceasing, people are isolated in hospitals or, in the case of weak symptoms, are put into quarantine. 6. Parameters or variables that are not known, such as T c , R 0 , S(0) and N , are subsumed into a single function R(t), which is obtained from real data, without having to speculate on how it comes about. This makes the model simple-and setting the weights constanteven simpler so that it can be set up quickly to produce satisfying prognoses. 7.
