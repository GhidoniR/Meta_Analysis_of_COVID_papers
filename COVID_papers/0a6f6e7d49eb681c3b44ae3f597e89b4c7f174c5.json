The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 depended fundamentally on human mobility patterns. This is highly pertinent to a country like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which as of 22nd February 2021 had a total of 374,691 cases and 6,457 deaths 3 . The kingdom frequently experiences major population movements, particularly religious mass gatherings. For instance, during Umrah and Hajj roughly 9.5 million pilgrims visit two Islamic sites in Makkah and Madinah annually 4, 5 and the Ministry of Health takes extraordinary public health measures to keep the pilgrims safe and major outbreaks have been by and large avoided in recent years. Further, an estimated 5 million Shiite Saudi nationals travel to Iran for pilgrimage, which became an early source of COVID-19 infections in the region 5, 6 . This movement has been reflected in the early phase of COVID-19 transmission within Saudi, as the first case was officially reported in Qatif (Eastern Region) on March 2 nd , 2020 7 .",

We analyzed the genomes to investigate the nucleotide changes and multiple mutation events that represent the first 6 months of the locally circulating pandemic lineages of the SARS-CoV-2 in Saudi Arabia and searched for potential association of polymorphic sites in the genome with available hospital records including severe disease and case fatality rates among the COVID-19 patients. We performed phylogenetic analysis to visualize the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 and the nature of transmission lineages during March-August, 2020. We have presented a snapshot of the genomic variation landscapes of the SARS-CoV-2 lineages in our study population and linked specific set of mutation events in the N gene to viral loads in a diverse population of COVID-19 patients in Saudi Arabia ( Figure S1 ). Finally, we experimentally show the functional impact of these mutations in the N protein on the virus' interactions with the host.",

The observed numbers of SNPs relative to the Wuhan reference follow the numbers observed in global samples ( Figure S3 ). We further detected 41 indels of which 26 reside in coding regions (Table S4 ). Most indels were specific to a single sample, and no identical indel was found in more than four samples. Compared with global SNP data, seven SNPs were found in higher frequencies (absolute difference > 0.1) in samples from Saudi Arabia ( Figure S2 ). These include the Spike protein D614G (A23403G) and three consecutive SNPs causing the R203K and G204R changes in the nucleoprotein (G28881A, G28882A, and G28883C).

Following the lifting of restrictions towards the end of June, the model estimates that R remained below or at 1 to the end of the period covered by the genetic data presented in this study. The effective population size (N e ) represents the relative diversity of the sequences collected in Saudi Arabia over the course of the outbreak ( Figure 1D ). The model predicts a peak in viral diversity at the beginning of June. This is ahead of the peak number of cases reported nationally and is likely influenced by the earlier peak in reported cases in the three cities, which contribute the most viral sequences to this analysis (Madinah, Makkah and Jeddah).",

Among the group with increased interaction, we identified many proteins associated with TOR and other signaling pathways (such as AKT1S1 and PIN1), proteins associated with the viral process, viral transcription, and negative regulation of RNA nuclear export (NUP153 and NUP98), and proteins involved in apoptotic and cell death processes (PAWR, ACIN1, and PDCD5) ( Figure 4D , Figure S12E ). We also identified proteins in the mutant condition that are linked with the immune system processes (PTMS), kinase activity (GCN1), and translation (e.g. MRPS36) ( Figure 4D , Figure S12E ). In the group with decreased interaction, we identified SNIP1 (NF-kappaB signaling), TMA16 (translation), and CSNK2B (casein kinase II) ( Figure 4D , Figure S12E ). Gene ontology analysis showed that the most enriched biological processes are associated with negative regulation of tRNA and ribosomal subunit export from the nucleus ( Figure 4E ). This finding suggests that the mutant virus may more efficiently inhibit and hijack the host translation to facilitate viral replication and pathogenesis. Further, many viruses can manipulate the host sumoylation process to enhance viral survival and pathogenesis 37 . By pathway enrichment analysis of differentially interacting proteins, we identified pathways associated with the sumoylation of host proteins and antiviral mechanisms ( Figure 4E ).",

To further understand the functional relevance of KR mutation in the N protein, we performed phosphoproteomic analysis in control and mutant conditions.

Although all individual phosphorylation sites may not be functionally important 32,54 , the specific enhancement of phosphorylation at serine 206 in the mutant N protein shown in this study hints at its functional significance. The serine 206 can form a phosphorylation-dependent binding site for protein 14-3-3, involved in cell cycle regulatory pathways regulating human and virus protein expression 55 . Multiple lines of evidence show that N protein phosphorylation is critical for its dynamic localization and function at replication-transcription complexes (RTC), where it promotes viral RNA transcription and translation by recruiting cellular factors 38-40,56-59 . The enrichment of glycogen synthase kinase 3 A (GSK3A) with the mutant N protein, could specifically phosphorylate serine 206 in the R203K/G204R mutation background. GSK3 was shown to be a key regulator of SARS-CoV replication due to its ability to phosphorylate N protein 39 . Phosphorylation of serine 206 acts as priming site for initiating a cascade of GSK-3 phosphorylation events 39,40 . Also, GSK3 inhibition dramatically reduces the production of viral particles and the cytopathic effect in SARS-CoV-infected cells 39 . Finally, our analysis of the transcriptome in transfected cells suggests that the mutant N protein induce overexpression of interferon-related genes that can aggravate the viral infection by inducing cytokine storm.",

RNA Isolation RNA was extracted using the Direct-Zol RNA Miniprep kit (Zymo Research, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions, along with several optimization steps to improve quality and quantity of RNA from clinical samples. The optimization included extending the TRIzol incubation period, and the addition of chloroform during initial lysis step to obtain the aqueous RNA layer. The quality control of purified RNA was performed using Broad Range Qubit kit (Thermo Fisher, USA) and RNA 6000 Nano LabChip kit (Agilent, USA) respectively. RT-PCR was conducted using the one-step Super Script III with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Thermo PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems, USA) and 7900 HT ABI machine.

Samples were considered COVID positive once the cycle threshold (Ct) values for both N1 and N2 regions were less than 40.

The cell lysate was incubated with prewashed MagStrep beads (30 \u00b5l per reaction) for 3 hours at 4 \u00b0C. The beads were then washed four times with wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% NP40, supplemented with",
