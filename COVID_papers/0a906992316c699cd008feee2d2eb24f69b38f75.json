At the population level, the rate of suicide in a country may be considered a crude indicator of the population's mental health. In Norway, between 600 and 700 persons kill themselves each year [4] , and it is suggested that the number of suicide attempts is approximately ten times higher [5] . While the current population suicide rate is somewhat lower compared with the peak in 1988 [6], it has been mostly unchanged since the mid-1990s [7] and appears to have remained similar to other countries in Western Europe and North America (approximately 12-13 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants) [6] . Mental health policies in Norway continue to aim to reduce the population suicide rate [8] .",

Further, a study in Spain followed up 1241 individuals following a first-time suicide attempt, and found that 20% of them re-attempted suicide at least once, supporting the notion that previous suicidal ideation and behaviors are major risk factors for subsequent suicide attempts [11] . In the USA in 2008-2009, more than eight million people over 18 years of age (3.7% of the adult population) reported having suicidal thoughts during the last year, while approximately one million people (0.5% of the adult population) reported having attempted suicide in the last year [1] . While most suicides are performed by men [6, 12, 13] , suicide thoughts and non-fatal suicidal behaviors are more often found among women. Suicide thoughts are also more commonly found in persons of young age and persons with mental health problems [9] . Mood disorders, and depression in particular, are strongly linked with suicidal behavior, but other mental health problems, such as anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and impulse control disorders, have also been found to increase the risk of suicide thoughts and attempts [13] [14] [15] [16] .",

The majority of deaths was among people over 70 years of age with at least one chronic disease [21] . However, in view of the severe restrictions in people's social life and a sharp increase in unemployment, much research in Norway and internationally has been concerned with the population's mental health in the pandemic context. A meta-analysis of studies published before May 2020 found high prevalence rates of stress (29.6%), anxiety (31.9%), and depression (33.7%) in general population studies [22] . With regard to suicidal ideation, a three-wave study from the UK found that significantly more participants had suicide thoughts during the second (9.2%) and third waves (9.8%) of data collection, compared to the first wave (8.2%), thus indicating a worrying time trend [23] . In a recent Norwegian study, however, the increase in point estimates of suicide thoughts in the population from before (3.2%) to after the COVID-19 outbreak (4.1%-4.2%) was not statistically significant [24] .",

Increased knowledge in this area may assist more targeted initiatives for suicide prevention. Previous studies have found that potentially stressful aspects specific to COVID-19, such as having economic concerns, experiencing isolation or quarantine, and perceiving to have high risk of complications, were associated with higher risk of mental health problems [25] [26] [27] . Although reviews have found weak evidence of increased suicidal behavior during previous emerging viral outbreaks [28] , recent studies suggest that mental health problems combined with a long-lasting stressful life experience, such as the COVID-19, may constitute a particularly problematic situation that can have an impact on suicide thoughts and behaviors in the population [29, 30] .",

Considering that the prevalence rate of suicide thoughts in this study was similar to the rate reported in another Norwegian study conducted during the same time [24] , the validity of our findings is supported. The differences in comparison to other countries may reflect general cross-national differences in suicidal ideation, considering that large differences in lifetime prevalence have been found between countries and regions [9, 13] . Possibly, the differences may also reflect differences related to the impact of COVID-19 between countries. No doubt, the UK and USA have had much larger numbers of infected and dead than Norway [36] . Infection rates and the number of citizens hospitalized or dead, but also burdens related to the general pandemic situation (restrictions on meeting people, worry about family and friends, financial concerns, etc.), may translate into higher rates of suicide thoughts in those countries most strongly affected by COVID-19.",

Based on cross-national data from 17 countries, Nock and colleagues [9] reported that more than 60% of all suicide attempts occur within one year after the onset of suicide thoughts. Considering these findings, our study's ratio of those having made a suicide attempt among those who currently have suicide thoughts seems low. We considered that having suicide thoughts might be a longstanding problem among a proportion of the sample, knowing that many people live with such thoughts over time without progressing onto suicide attempts. However, this interpretation was not supported, given the only marginal overlap between previous and current suicide thoughts. This may imply that the vast majority of those reporting current suicide thoughts did not have this problem previously. Alternatively, or in combination with the former, some of those indicating current suicide thoughts may have felt that their current situation was most pressing, and while reporting current suicide thoughts they may have failed to indicate previous suicide thoughts. In any case, for persons with suicide thoughts first arising during the early stage of COVID-19, one may be particularly concerned about their development and whether they will translate into suicide attempts at a later stage.",

Moreover, lower age and using alcohol daily were associated with higher odds of current suicide thoughts. These results are in concert with findings from other general population studies. For example, Nock and colleagues [9] reported that younger age and having a mental disorder were consistent predictors of suicide thoughts, plans, and attempts. Moreover, during the COVID-19 pandemic, suicidal ideation has also been found to decrease progressively with age [30] . Mental disorders such as anxiety [39, 40] and depression [41, 42] have often been linked with higher risk of suicide thoughts, and use of alcohol-i.e., higher drinking frequency, higher drinking quantity, and binge drinkinghas also been found to increase the risk [43, 44] .",

Both factors have been found previously to be related to high stress levels corresponding to symptom-defined PTSD [25] , and a pathway from risk group and economic concerns via high stress and anxiety to suicide thoughts, is viable. A pathway to suicide thoughts may also go via depression, as self-identifying as being in the risk group and having economic concerns have been found to be associated with higher risk of depression [26] .",

The study is therefore limited in its mere detection of factors statistically associated with suicide thoughts. While a range of variables were used as possible predictors of suicide thoughts, the inclusion of additional variables might well have improved the model. For example, anger, impulsivity, worries about one's physical health, and suicidality have been shown to be higher among individuals with psychiatric illnesses compared to healthy controls [45] . Thus, factors such as pandemic-related anger and worries about physical health might also be associated with suicide thoughts and suicide attempts during the COVID-19 crisis.",

Possibly, respondents might have felt more affected by the pandemic situation, compared to those opting not to participate in the study. The same pattern of sample skewness has been shown in COVID-19 studies from several countries [17, 46, 47] .

Moreover, studies have demonstrated that the use of single-item measures can be a valid and reliable option for measuring mental health variables [48] [49] [50] [51] . Additionally, assessing whether a person has had suicide thoughts and attempts during a given period is relatively straightforward, and for this purpose we believe the chosen questionnaire items were appropriate. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that those indicating current suicide thoughts may have failed to indicate previous suicide thoughts.",
