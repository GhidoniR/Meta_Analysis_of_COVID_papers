            "text": "This paper presents a framework that may help explain the interactions among capitalism, infectious disease, and environmental change in the world and in the Mediterranean region. Capitalism and the longevity of national governments require continued investment and economic growth. This disrupts the environment, most urgently in terms of climate change, which is expected to single out the Mediterranean region for droughts and heat and to lead to mass migrations of people and animals. Capitalism also disrupts the habitats of fauna, and creates factory farming and markets for the sale of animals from local ecologies that are being \"opened up\" for profitable use-all of which leads to increased interaction between potential vectors of infectious diseases and humans. Capitalist globalization has encouraged widespread international and other travel of people and goods, which can carry infectious people or animal vectors across long distances very rapidly. In sum, capitalism requires development, which creates environmental and infectious disease crises. Solving this problem will require profound political and economic change. In the immediate term, public health and medical institutions need to be protected against the pressures of austerity.",

            "text": "Capitalism is a system of production and distribution that uses the labor power of workers to transform natural resources into products for sale. The goal, which is by no means always realized, is to sell these products and make a profit. If the profitability of investments is not sufficiently high to balance the risk of loss, companies save their profits, which leads to a slowing or reversal of economic growth or investment in financial instruments in ways that create \"bubbles\" of unrealistic speculation. When these bubbles burst, production slows, taxes fall, and unemployment and bankruptcies increase. This also can lead to political crises and, in some cases, to revolutions (Foster 2013b; Harvey 2007; Kose and Ohnsorge 2019; Roberts 2016; Smith 1984) .",

Corporations find it profitable to raise common meat sources such as pigs and chickens in factory farms where they are jammed together. All of these processes allow viruses or other agents to jump from species to species, and to mutate into virulent forms.

Since the discovery of effective antiretroviral therapies, the interests of pharmaceutical firms in maximizing profits have limited the application of antiretroviral therapies in \"treatment as prevention\" strategies (Chan 2015; Kippax and Stephenson 2016) . International and philanthropic efforts to implement treatment as prevention using antiretroviral therapy have increased access to this therapy, but these efforts remain insufficient and may be seriously impeded by the severe economic downturn and fiscal crises that began in 2019 and are being greatly enhanced by the COVID-19 crisis (Fauci and Lane 2020; Kates et al. 2018 ). Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have likewise been shaped by the need for capitalism for growth and profits-although the pandemic has indeed created a profitability and growth crisis that has been reflected in different countries by different policies in terms of how and when they have shut and reopened various public services and industries, how they have attempted to sustain the livelihoods of those who cannot work (and therefore \"effective demand\") and thus sales volumes, and governmental and individual reactions to the use of face masks. It is clear that, in spite of strong tendencies among scientists to cooperate and make information widely available in the face of the pandemic, the need for pharmaceutical companies and governments to prevail in competition has created barriers to this.",

These pose the threat of increased social conflict and war.

Rising sea levels may create new mosquito-breeding swamps or other pools of stagnant water, increasing rates of malaria. Drought will probably lead to migrations of vector-bearing fauna, and higher temperatures are likely to increase the frequency of vectors feeding on human blood. Nonetheless, there are a wide variety of arthropods and other vectors (carrying different pathogens), some of which may become more prevalent and some of which may become less prevalent due to the drought. It is thus difficult to predict which specific vectorborne diseases will become major problems, and additional research on this is clearly needed. We can be reasonably sure, however, that high levels of urbanization and internal and international migration will tend to magnify the outbreaks that do occur.",

Capitalism also enables the discovery and production of medicines and vaccines to mitigate epidemics, but limits the extent to which such mitigation is effective.
