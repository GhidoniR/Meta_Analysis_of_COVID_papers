Thus, factors influencing students' health behaviors during the COVID-19 outbreak should be examined. Purpose: To our knowledge, little is known about stress, adversity quotient, and health behaviors of university students in Thailand. Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine the relationships among socioeconomic factors, stress, and adversity quotient influencing university students' health behavior during the COVID-19 crisis. Patients and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional predictive study; it was included 416 undergraduate students \u226518 years of age at a university in Thailand. We used descriptive statistics, chi-squared test, and stepwise multiple linear regression for data analysis. Results: The results indicated that most participants were women (71.90%), and the highest proportion of students were enrolled in College of Politics and Governance (25.24%). Most of the students had a high stress level (M = 3.54, SD = 0.53), high adversity quotient (M = 3.77, SD = 0.63), and good health behavior (M = 3.06, SD = 0.53). Adversity quotient, stress, and current faculty/college were significant predictors of health behaviors of undergrad students (total variance: 37.2%). Conclusion: Total adversity quotient was the strongest predictor of health behavior, followed by stress and current faculty/colleges. On the basis of our results, we suggested that faculty members, caretakers, and interdisciplinary care teams should consider adversity quotient and stress in developing activities to encourage and promote students' physical and mental health behaviors, particularly during the COVID-19.",

In terms of gender, male to female ratio 1.13:1, Thai nationality were 4,597, unknown nationals (597 cases), Myanmar (125 cases), India (77 cases), Cambodia (73 cases), and others (53 cases) (Emergency Operation Center Department of Disease Control, 2020). Since December 25, 2020, COVID-19 re-emerged in Thailand, and the tendency of patients to spread in each province is increasing in all age groups, including university students. 9 In many countries, including Thailand, policies have been established to prevent the spread, control, and resolve COVID-19 outbreaks, such as strict city-wide lockdown or closure of areas that are home to large numbers of people, which prevents epidemics from spreading, 10 and ban on foreign tourists from entering the country. These measures have considerably influenced people's lives, including changing their health habits, lifestyle, and slowing down the economy. 10 It also affects the teaching and learning of students who must adapt to government policies, including wearing masks; staying away from people with respiratory symptoms (eg, cold symptoms, cough, and sneezing); washing their hands thoroughly with soap and water or alcohol hand sanitizer; avoiding unnecessary contact with eyes, nose, and mouth; avoiding sharing belongings with others; eating hot cooked food; and avoiding crowded places. 9 If this is inevitable, students must protect themselves by wearing a surgical mask.",

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused tremendous stress and anxiety in people, including students 22,23 because of various reasons, including lockdown and fear of infection. 24 Most people, including students, experience stress, fear, and anxiety when facing emerging diseases and feel overwhelmed. 25 Government policies such as maintaining social distance and lockdown can make people feel alone, stressed, and anxious, as well as affect their physical and mental health. It is essential for individuals to prepare themselves to protect against COVID-19. 13 Our results reveal that both male and female undergraduate students had severe stress (15.87% and 44.47%, respectively). Implementing health behaviors to protect oneself against COVID-19 can reduce students' stress related to the disease. 26 Li et al 27 examined the relationship between health behaviors and perceived stress in Chinese residents; their results revealed that health behaviors were negatively associated with perceived stress, with 39.89% of residents at risk of stress. 27 Additionally, a factor that can predict health behavior in undergraduate students of this study was current faculty/ college. Students from science and health science schools had better health behaviors than those from humanities and social science schools. Students from health sciences schools, such as nursing student, may have higher knowledge and awareness of the COVID-19 outbreak and the relevant self-care behaviors, partly because they may be taught that in their curriculums, such as good selfmanagement of physical and mental health. 28 In line with Raingruber 29 who found that highly educated individuals practice more health-promoting behaviors than those with low literacy levels, this finding is consistent with Gall\u00e8 et al, 30 who found understanding knowledge and behaviors associated with the COVID-19 outbreak in Italian undergraduate students. A previous study also indicated that students in non-health-related fields had a lower level of knowledge compared with students in health sciences. 30 However, the study of Alzoubi et al, 31 who indicated the inexistence of differences in COVID-19 knowledge between medical and nonmedical colleges. They found that the knowledge of medical and nonmedical students about social media, the Internet, and television had no significant difference (p >0.05). Therefore, undergraduate students still required more information and directed measures, good welfare, and awareness campaigns from government and related agencies to improve the knowledge, attitude, and skills in some critical components to contain the COVID-19 crisis.",
