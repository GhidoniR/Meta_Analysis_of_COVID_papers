As part of an effort to analyze and, if necessary, remediate these structures as deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), this work presents a detailed analysis of 81 crystal structures of the main protease 3CL pro , an important target for the design of drugs against COVID-19. The structures of the unliganded enzyme and its complexes with a number of inhibitors were determined by multiple research groups using different experimental approaches and conditions; the resulting structures span 13 different polymorphs representing seven space groups. The structures of the enzyme itself, all determined by molecular replacement, are highly similar, with the exception of one polymorph with a different inter-domain orientation. However, a number of complexes with bound inhibitors were found to pose significant problems. Some of these could be traced to faulty definitions of geometrical restraints for ligands and to the general problem of a lack of such information in the PDB depositions. Several problems with ligand definition in the PDB itself were also noted. In several cases extensive corrections to the models were necessary to adhere to the evidence of the electron-density maps. Taken together, this analysis of a large number of structures of a single, medically important protein, all determined within less than a year using modern experimental tools, should be useful in future studies of other systems of high interest to the biomedical community. \u2020 A key to the space-group symbol extended by '_k' is given in Table 3 . \u2021 Inhibitors are identified by their common names or, if such a name was not listed in the PDB deposition, by the CCP4 code used by the PDB. \u00a7 The original PDB depositions 7jox and 7joy were standardized, re-refined and redeposited or updated in the PDB by the original authors (Lee et al., 2020) . \u2020 In most cases the space-group symbol is extended by '_k', where 'k' designates a distinct polymorph within the same space group.",

Structural biologists were among the first to swing into action, with the first structure of a SARS-CoV-2 protein being deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB; Berman et al., 2000) within two weeks of the release of the genomic sequence of the virus. This was the structure of the main cysteine protease (PDB entry 6lu7; , varyingly named 3CL pro or M pro and sometimes NSP5. This first model was followed by 80 PDB depositions (as of 15 October 2020) of crystal structures of the same enzyme in the free apo form (Table 1 ) and in complex with a variety of both covalently and noncovalently bound inhibitors (Table 2) . (See also the computer-searchable Supplementary Table S1 .) The structures were obtained using different X-ray sources (synchrotrons, rotating-anode generators in home laboratories and X-ray free-electron lasers), as well as with neutrons from a spallation source. Some structures of identical complexes were determined in different space groups, sometimes under different conditions, and/or by different research groups. In addition, structures of 115 potential ligand complexes of 3CL pro determined in large-scale ligand fragment-screening campaigns assisted by the Pan-Dataset Density Analysis (PanDDA; Pearce, Krojer, Bradley et al., 2017) methodology have been deposited. In the following, 3CL pro refers to the enzyme from SARS-CoV-2, while homologous enzymes from other coronaviruses are identified fully with the names of the parent viruses.",

Some attempts to collect and analyze a large assembly of structures of a single protein have been reported in the past (for example, for the protease encoded by the human immunodeficiency virus; Vondrasek et al., 1997; Vondrasek & Wlodawer, 2002) , but no detailed assessment of their relative quality and true differences was performed. There have been specific campaigns to validate and correct PDB models of medicinally important drug-design targets, for instance metallo--lactamases (Raczynska et al., 2018) or proteins that bind cisplatin (Shabalin et al., 2015) . The analysis, verification and improvement (if necessary) of all crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins is already the subject of an ongoing project (Wlodawer et al., 2020; Brzezinski et al., 2021) , but without a dedicated overview and comparison of different structures. It is our aim to present here such a detailed analysis for 3CL pro that may be useful not only for this particular protein target but also to guide any future projects aimed at the interpretation of multiple structures of medicinally important macromolecules.",

            "text": "As is typical for coronaviruses, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes two large viral polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, which need to be processed before an active virion can be reconstituted. This task is accomplished by two virally encoded cysteine proteases: the chymotrypsin-like main protease (3CL pro ) and papain-like protease (PL pro ). The absolute requirement for the activity of 3CL pro for viral replication has been demonstrated for other coronaviruses through mutagenesis experiments (Kim et al., 1995; Stobart et al., 2012) . 3CL pro proteolytically processes the viral polyproteins at 11 junctions, generating the individual proteins critical for virus replication, including autoprocessing itself (Hegyi & Ziebuhr, 2002) . It is important to note that there are no close human analogs of coronaviral 3CL pro , and thus interference with the activity of this enzyme is not likely to lead to serious side effects, as was previously postulated for the very closely related protease from SARS-CoV (Anand et al., 2003) . Inhibition of the activity of viral proteases has been shown to be of practical therapeutic importance for diseases such as those caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; Wlodawer & Vondrasek, 1998 ) and hepatitis C virus (HCV; Bacon et al., 2011) . Since 3CL pro is a cysteine protease, albeit with a fold related to the serine protease chymotrypsin, there is a good research papers IUCrJ (2021) . 8, 238-256 Mariusz Jaskolski et al.

PDB code Resolution (\u00c5 ) R free (original/re-refined) Space group \u2020 Temperature X-ray source Remarks chance that specific inhibitors of this enzyme could be developed, making 3CL pro an important drug target for antivirals. These concepts have been pursued in the past for SARS-CoV 3CL pro (Pillaiyar et al., 2016) , although the rapid disappearance of that virus decreased interest in such work, and they have now been proposed again (Konwar & Sarma, 2021) .",

However, in >70% of the deposited structures the dimer twofold-symmetry axis coincides with a crystallographic dyad, and the deposited models contain only one subunit of the dimer (Table 3 ). The first $15 N-terminal residues, residues in the region 115-141 of the catalytic domain and multiple residues in the C-terminal region participate in the formation of the dimer interface [ Fig. 1(a) ]. Isolated monomers exhibit diminished levels of catalytic activity or are inactive, and dimerization inhibitors have been designed for SARS-CoV 3CL pro (Barrila et al., 2006) and SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro (Goyal & Goyal, 2020) . Although the N-terminus is involved in dimerization contacts, it is flexible and extends into the solvent, consistent with the lack of a detrimental effect of even substantial N-terminally attached expression tags, as exemplified by PDB entry 7cbt.

The relative rigidity of the binding pocket is clearly visible compared with regions of increased anisotropic movement such as some loops in the catalytic domain, parts of the C-terminal regions (orange to red) and the N-and C-termini. N-terminal tags are common and are distant from crystal contacts. In contrast, in the single structure with a C-terminal His 6 tag (PDB entry 6wtt, space group P3 2 21), only the C-terminus is exposed and disordered, while the N-terminal Ser1 participates in dimer contacts and in close crystal contacts, leaving no room for an N-terminal tag.

Table 3 Key to different crystal forms of 3CL pro with approximate unit-cell parameters and solvent content. different packing modes of the polymorphs do affect the accessibility of the binding site in cristallo, potentially hampering ligand soaking; however, most of the liganded crystal structures were presumably obtained from protein stock pre-incubated with the ligands. We note here that since many structures have not been described in a publication, many of the experimental details are often missing. In addition, in PDB entry 7khp crystal packing induced a reverse reaction leading to the covalent attachment of the C-terminus of one protein molecule to the catalytic site of an adjacent symmetry-related molecule (Lee et al., 2020) . The imposition of strict crystallographic symmetry in the most prevalent C2 polymorphs and others (Table 3) precludes differences between the two molecules of the dimer. Analysis of any conformational differences, however, is necessary to explain possible cooperativity or allosteric effects (Barrila et al., 2006) .",

However, most of these structures are PanDDA group depositions, which are not considered further here because they are not directly comparable to conventionally determined protein-ligand complex structures. PanDDA is, in effect, a multi-data-set map contrast-enhancement procedure that allows the placement of a known specific fragmentscreening ligand into weak binding-site density . The low minimum real-space correlation coefficients (RSCC > 0.7) that are considered to be useful for potential leads in PanDDA fragment screening are not acceptable by conventional standards (Cereto-Massagu\u00e9 et al., 2013; Pozharski et al., 2013; Wlodawer et al., 2018) . The mean RSCC for a set of 120 3CL pro -binding ligand fragments extracted from the PDB validation reports is 0.74, with an average ligand occupancy of 0.62, while for the ligand structures in Table 2 the mean RSCC is 0.88 with a mean occupancy of 0.95. Re-refinement of the provided model against the deposited data usually leads to inferior maps for weak ligands compared with the deposited maps obtained using the full PanDDA procedure. Routine recalculation of the event maps from the PDB-deposited PanDDA data is currently not feasible, and the crucial single data set for the ligand-containing structure is not (or is not consistently) provided. Our analysis therefore concentrated on 81 individual structures that included 24 depositions of the enzyme without any ligands Two views of the substrate-binding pocket of 3CL pro . The area of interaction between a putative substrate and the enzyme is exemplified by the binding of leupeptin (PDB entry 6yz6). The leupeptin molecule in the active site is shown as sticks, with C atoms in gray, O atoms in red and N atoms in blue. 3CL pro residues forming hydrogen bonds to the ligand are shown as sticks with C atoms in light green. Hydrogen bonds are shown as dashed lines. The covalent bond between leupeptin and Cys145 is shown in magenta. near the active site (Table 1) and 57 complexes with a number of different ligands, the vast majority of them being inhibitors covalently linked to the active site (Table 2) . These structures were determined in 13 different polymorphs (unit cells) of seven different space groups (Table 3) from crystals grown using a variety of crystallization conditions. Experimental diffraction data were collected using several types of radiation sources (Supplementary Table S1 ). Since most otherwise isomorphous structures were refined by their authors with molecules located in inconsistent parts of the unit cell (or sometimes completely outside of it), all models considered here were first given a standardized placement in the unit cell with the help of the ACHESYM server (Kowiel et al., 2014) . The final structures (some of which had to be further refined) were deposited in the database at https://covid-19. bioreproducibility.org (Brzezinski et al., 2021) .",

For the purpose of the work described here, the diffraction data for the I2 structures (PDB entries 6zru, 6xch, 6xqu, 6xb0, 6xb1 and 6xb2) were reindexed to the standard C2 setting by the operation (\u00c0h \u00c0 l, k, h), with appropriate transformation of the atomic coordinates.

The reason was that the monoclinic angles of these two crystals, as originally deposited in the PDB, were very close to and slightly above 90 , whereas it was necessary to make one of them slightly lower than 90 ( 0 = 180 \u00c0 ) and to reindex the diffraction data accordingly (\u00c0h, \u00c0k, l) in order to make the isomorphism obvious and the two structures directly compatible.

The authors suggest that the 'room-temperature structure of the 3CL M pro ligand-free form may be the more physiologically relevant structure for performing moleculardocking studies to estimate drug binding and enable drug design'. They provided at least two different examples showing that the room-temperature structure differs from its counterpart at low temperature. They noted that the 'catalytic water' molecule, usually located between His41, His164 and Asp187, is not present in the 2 \u00c5 resolution structure obtained from flash-cooled crystals (PDB entry 6m03). However, although this crucial water molecule was not modeled in the coordinate set deposited with PDB entry 6m03, it is very clearly present in the electron-density map and its omission is an obvious error. This conclusion is also supported by all other ligand-free 3CL pro structures obtained at cryogenic temperature, in which the corresponding water molecule is clearly visible in the electron density. The other reported difference between the room-temperature and low-temperature structures involves a different conformation of residues 192-198, with the peptide bond of Ala194 in PDB entry 6wqf flipped compared with the 100 K structure (PDB entry 6y2e). While supported by the electron-density maps, the purported importance of this feature is undercut by the fact that other room-temperature structures, including that resulting from the joint X-ray/neutron refinement by the same team (Kneller, Phillips, Weiss et al., 2020 ; PDB entry 7jun), do not show a similar peptide flip.",

A superposition of the coordinates of the active sites of the 3CL pro structures for the highest resolution data sets obtained at room temperature (PDB entry 6xb0) and at 100 K (PDB entry 6yb7) is shown in Fig. 4 . It confirms that the differences between structures determined with data collected at different temperatures and using different kinds of radiation sources are not significant (r.m.s.d. of 0.38 \u00c5 for all 306 C pairs), despite the oxidation of the catalytic cysteine in the roomtemperature structure. Structures determined with radiation generated by a conventional X-ray source and by an XFEL are also not significantly different, with the differences between XFEL structures belonging to different space groups vastly exceeding the differences due to either temperature or radiation source. These results may lead to a generally applicable conclusion that, in the absence of special conditions that would clearly require data collection at room temperature or using very short pulses of radiation, crystallographic data obtained at standard cryogenic temperatures may be sufficient for the interpretation of the details of the active sites of enzymes required to propose ligand binding and ultimately for drug design.

It is not clear how the PK8 compound is attached to the enzyme in PDB entry 6yt8, since the electrondensity map does not support the original modeling with two disordered molecules. PDB entry 7cx9 with inhibitor INZ-1 (designated in the PDB as GKF) is one of the two covalent complexes in which the value of the torsion angle N-C -C -S in Cys145 (\u00c0155 ) is far outside the range found in all other covalent complexes (\u00c050 to \u00c095 ) (Supplementary Table S2 ). The compound INZ-1 in the model with PDB code 7cx9 forms a flat thioester connection, although it is presented as an aldehyde in the PDB. This case illustrates a notorious problem in the PDB of inappropriate differentiation between S linkages with carboxylic versus aldehyde/ketone groups of the inhibitors. In the former moiety the connecting thioester group is flat, whereas in the latter case the connecting thiohemiacetal (or thiohemiketal) group contains a chiral sp 3 C atom with either R or S chirality (and sometimes both). In the description of many complexes shown in Table 2 (and in other structures in the PDB as well) the proper nomenclature is not used.",

The inhibitors are baicalein, masitinib, AZD6482, carmofur, leupeptin, telaprevir, boceprevir, narlaprevir and GC376. the thiol group of Cys145, leading to the formation of hemithioacetal or hemithioketal linkages, respectively. Among the 38 coordinate sets, there are 23 hemiacetals and 29 hemiketals, with some structures containing multiple molecules. In all of these complexes the C atom connected to the cysteine S atom is chiral due to sp 3 hybridization and has a hydroxyl OH group as one of its substituents. A characteristic difference between the hemiacetal versus hemiketal connections is that the OH group of hemiacetals is typically directed towards the oxyanion hole, which consists of the main-chain amides of residues 143-145, and forms a hydrogen bond to the peptide N atom of Cys145, whereas in hemiketals this group points in the opposite direction and forms a hydrogen bond to the N \"2 atom of His41. In both cases the configuration of the asymmetric C atom remains S, even though the direction of the OH group is opposite. This confusing nomenclature is due to the change of substituent priority at the linking C atom. There are only a few exceptions to this rule. The first case comprises two hemiacetal-containing structures (PDB entry 6yz7 and molecules A and B of PDB entry 7d1m) which display disorder of this group, with partially occupied hydroxyl O atoms in both positions. A second exception is the hemiketal-containing complex with UAW243 in PDB entry 6xfn with R chirality and with the OH group hydrogen-bonded to the N \"2 atom of His41. Moreover, the hemiacetal connection in molecule C of PDB entry 6wtt is presented in the PDB with R chirality of the central C atom and with the hydroxyl group hydrogen-bonded to N \"2 of His41, contrary to the evidence from the difference electron density and subsequent re-refinement, which clearly supports the standard S configuration as in the two other molecules in this structure. The structure with PDB code 6xfn is the other case in which the 1 torsion angle N-C -C -S of Cys145 has an unusual value of about +35 , whereas in all other structures with a chiral C linker atom this angle lies in the range between \u00c050 and \u00c095 . 5.2.3. Leupeptin. Leupeptin is a well known tripeptide inhibitor of serine and cysteine proteases. The two structures of its complex with 3CL pro represent an interesting case of different approaches to modeling the inhibitor molecule and its link to the active-site residue, rather than genuine differences. The structures in question were determined at 2.2 \u00c5 resolution at room temperature (PDB entry 6xch; Kneller, Galanie et al., 2020) and at 1.7 \u00c5 resolution under cryogenic conditions ( Fig. 3 ; PDB entry 6yz6; G\u00fc nther et al., 2020). The description of the inhibitor and its link to Cys145 is conventional in the room-temperature structure, with only a single R stereoisomer of the link present in the model and a distance between Cys145 S and C4 of the inhibitor of 1.8 \u00c5 , with no indication of the presence of the second stereoisomer. However, in the low-temperature structure there is a very clear indication of the presence of both diastereomers, which evidently resulted from the nonstereospecific character of the inhibition reaction. To take account of this situation, the original authors of PDB entry 6yz6 modeled the inhibitor as two overlapping leupeptin molecules differing only in the absolute configuration of the substituents at the C4 atom. Despite the 1.7 \u00c5 resolution of the diffraction data, such modeling resulted in an unlikely S -C4 distance of only 1.4 \u00c5 . When the structure was re-refined by us with a single leupeptin molecule and with the O4 atom of the argininal (AR7) moiety assumed to be in two alternative configurations, the model fitted the electron-density map much better and the S -C4 distance converged at 1.8 \u00c5 . These two structures illustrate how nonparsimonious modeling and contradiction of established rules can result in implausible models, leading to spurious differences that do not represent any real variations between structures.",

Strangely, without any logical justification, this partially modeled inhibitor was labeled FK3 by the PDB, whereas enzyme-bound telaprevir is labeled SV6. In all structures the hydroxyl group in the covalent linkage between the S atom of Cys145 and the inhibitor forms a very short hydrogen bond to N \"2 of His41, which is part of the catalytic dyad. This interaction provides additional stabilization of His41, which in turn interacts with the catalytic water through a hydrogen bond involving N 1 . The conformation of the norvaline side chain is somewhat variable in the absence of good hydrophobic interactions, and the end of the inhibitor chain is not visible in the electron-density maps in any of these structures. A large, unexplained difference density is seen adjacent to the norvaline residue in the structure with PDB code 6zrt. The structures of the cyclopentane-coupled proline and tert-butyl side chains are very similar in all complexes, although some chiral C atoms appear to have a visibly planar character enforced by the erroneous restraints used for the model in PDB entry 6xqs. The conformation of the cyclohexyl side chain varies between the structures, with the chirality of the CBH atom differing from the other three structures in PDB entry 6zrt and in molecule A of PDB entry 7c7p.

Boceprevir was later brought into clinical practice by Merck as a hepatitis C drug, although it is no longer used for this purpose. Its structure was first determined in complex with the HCV protease (Prongay et al., 2007) and it was one of the first previously characterized protease inhibitors that was shown to be a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro .

The configuration of C43 is marked as R, but this is due to the assumption that one of the atoms bound to it is an H atom and not a heavy substituent attached via an S atom. The absolute configuration of the C43 chiral center listed in the PDB should therefore be treated as dubious, at least. 5.2.7. GC376 and its variants. GC376 is a prodrug of a dipeptide inhibitor that contains a sulfonic group warhead that is cleaved off when the compound reacts with the active-site nucleophile of a protease, forming a covalent adduct, which in the case of 3CL pro is a thiohemiacetal link at the thiol group of the catalytic Cys145 residue. The inhibitor was designed as a member of a series of compounds that had generally similar structures, but different reactive groups, and that were shown to be active against a variety of viral proteases, including those research papers of coronaviruses (Kim et al., 2012) . Seven structures of complexes of 3CL pro with GC376 have been analyzed in this project. They were all obtained under cryogenic conditions and their resolutions range from 2.35 to 1.35 \u00c5 . The unreacted parent prodrug was assigned the code K36 by the PDB, with an S configuration at the C21 reactive center. In the complexes, the sulfonic group of K36 is substituted by the S atom of Cys145, with the chiral C21 atom of the inhibitor again linked to sulfur. The configuration at C21 of the conjugated K36 inhibitor is marked as S, but a virtually identical conjugate, named B1S, in which the chirality at the C21 center is R, was included in the structure with PDB code 6wtt. In light of the robust and unique orientation of the bulk of the inhibitor attached to C21, inversion of the configuration of this atom consists of swapping the sulfur substituent and the OH group of the hemiacetal group. In the structure with PDB code 6wtt there are three complex molecules in the asymmetric unit. In two of them the ligand was defined as K36, while in the third it is B1S. To add to the confusion, an inhibitor identical to B1S was defined as UED in the structure with PDB code 6wtk. An attempt to clarify the situation by removal of the unnecessary multiplication of standard PDB groups was further complicated by the use of a vastly different numbering of identical atoms, a problem that has been identified in the PDB in the past (Jaskolski, 2013) but still not ameliorated. After rerefinement of PDB entry 6wtt we concluded that, in any case, the chirality at C21 was identical in all three copies of the complex present in the asymmetric unit.",

The structure with PDB code 7cbt was a particular outlier, since part of the main chain of molecule B (extending between residues 211 and 290) had signs of serious mistracing, which is rather surprising in a structure determined by molecular replacement using the structure with PDB code 6y2e, which did not suffer from such problems, as a model. Several other parts of the model also had to be corrected during re-refinement. An inconsistency in the deposited diffraction data was found for PDB entry 6wtk. This structure was originally refined at 2 \u00c5 resolution, although data apparently extending to 1.2 \u00c5 resolution were present in the structure-factor file, indicating an attempt to measure reflections far beyond the real diffraction limit. Our re-refined model utilized the original 2 \u00c5 resolution data. In collaboration with the original depositors of PDB entry 7brr, we reprocessed the diffraction data to 1.4 \u00c5 resolution, re-refined the structure and redeposited it as PDB entry 7d1m, replacing the original entry. Due to reprocessing and the use of fully anisotropic ADP parameters, the resulting electron-density maps improved sufficiently to allow us to add an alternative conformation to the bound ligand and to correct the conformations of a number of side chains.",

The covalent link between Cys145 and the inhibitor indicates that the reaction leading to the departure of the sulfonic group is not completely stereospecific, since in at least two structures (PDB entries 7d1m and 7c8u) both the R and S diastereomers of the thiohemiacetal atom C21 can be unambiguously discerned in the electron density. Only the predominant S isomer was modeled in the other GC376 complex structures, with the hydroxyl O22 atom pointing into the oxyanion hole of the enzyme. O atom O30 of the 2-pyrrolidone group that occupies the S1 subsite of the enzyme is the acceptor of a very strong hydrogen bond from the N \"2 atom of His164 and possibly also from N 1 of His172. However, the conformation of the latter residue is inconsistent among the compared structures, since its potential interactions with the main-chain carbonyls of Ser1 and Gly138 (or Ile136) may lead to different interpretations of the hydrogen-bond network.

The compounds are named UAW241, UAW243, UAW246, UAW247 and UAW248, respectively, in the PDB depositions, whereas the first two are named calpain inhibitor II and calpain inhibitor XII in the publication, with the other three named there as UAWJ24x. Re-refinement of PDB entry 6xfn uncovered incorrect chirality of the P1 norvaline residue in the original model, which is most likely a consequence of incorrect restraints for this moiety. This problem was corrected during the re-refinement. The binding mode of UAW243 is very different from the other inhibitors in this series, in that the nominally P1 norvaline occupies the S1 0 pocket of the enzyme, whereas the P1 0 pyridine occupies the S1 pocket. The P2 leucine and P3 cyclohexyl residues point out into the solvent, with the very weak electron density of the latter residue raising the question of whether it is still actually present or whether it has been hydrolyzed during the crystallization experiment. The conformation of the other four inhibitors is internally very consistent, as well as consistent with GC376, although the formal chirality of the C21 atom (in GC376 nomenclature) depends on the presence or absence of the P1 0 side chain of the inhibitor. In all structures the P1 side chain is stabilized by a hydrogen bond to N \"2 of His164. The hydrophobic P2 residue (Leu or Phe) occupies a pocket with mixed hydrophobic/hydrophilic character, and the (also hydrophobic) P3 residues, which are located on the surface of the enzyme, assume a highly variable conformation.",

These structures resulted from a remarkably serendipitous crystallization of the native and C145A variants of 3CL pro : while molecules A of the dimer in the asymmetric unit were unremarkable, molecules B were found to form an infinite chain in the crystal by inserting the C-terminus of one molecule into the active site of its translational copy. This packing arrangement was identical in both structures, but whereas an unmodified C-terminus was observed in the crystals of the C145A active-site mutant, in the catalytic site of the wild-type enzyme the wedged carboxylate of Gln306 was found to be linked via a covalent acyl-enzyme bond to the Cys145 nucleophile. The binding of the carboxylic group illustrates the reversible character of the reaction catalyzed by 3CL pro . In the forward direction, a peptide bond is split into its amino and carboxy constituents. In the reverse direction observed in PDB entry 7khp, the carboxy substrate forms an acyl-enzyme thioester link at Cys145 but the reaction has to stop there as there is no amino halfsubstrate/product for its completion. Although the above two structures were initially inconsistently presented, they were later modified by the original authors to emphasize their isomorphism (this required the replacement of PDB entry 7jox by PDB entry 7khp in the PDB and a shift of the coordinates of PDB entry 7joy). A comparison of the acyl-enzyme complex structure with PDB code 7khp with the highest resolution structure of a complex with a long inhibitor molecule (telaprevir; PDB entry 7k6d) shows a remarkable similarity in the location of the side chains of the substrate and inhibitor in the S1-S4 pockets of the enzyme (Fig. 7) . The presence of the Side-by-side comparison of the binding of the autoprocessed C-terminal peptide (PDB entry 7khp) and telaprevir (PDB entry 7k6d) in the active site of 3CL pro . Hydrogen bonds are shown as dashed lines. The protein molecule is represented as a semi-transparent charge-density surface with positive charge shown in blue, negative charge in red and hydrophobic character shown in white. The ligands in the active site are shown in stick representation with C atoms in light green, O atoms in red and N atoms in blue. 3CL pro residues forming hydrogen bonds to the ligands are shown as sticks under the charge-density surface. covalent acyl-enzyme linkage in the inhibitor complexes did not lead to any significant rearrangement of the active-site residues compared with the free enzyme analyzed in the neutron study. In particular, the conformation of Cys145, the orientation of His41 and His164 and the location of the catalytic water molecule were highly conserved. The most significant shift of the main and side chains of the enzyme is due to the much larger P4 residue in the inhibitor, a cyclopentane-coupled proline, compared with the Val303 side chain of the substrate, culminating in repulsions exerted on Gln192 and also leading to a peptide flip of this residue. A notable feature of the structure of the acyl-enzyme intermediate in PDB entry 7khp is the presence of a weak electron-density peak located 2.66 \u00c5 from the C atom of Gln306 and 2.85 \u00c5 from the N \"2 atom of His41. This density was interpreted by Lee and coworkers as a water molecule poised for a nucleophilic attack on the thioester group. Since the protonation of these residues can only be inferred indirectly by modeling, a confirming neutron diffraction structure of this particular crystal form of 3CL pro might be of particularly high interest.",

            "text": "Based on the appearance of the nuclear density map, Kneller and coworkers proposed a model in which both His41 and His164 were doubly protonated (cationic), while Cys145 was deprotonated (anionic). The question of the protonation state of these residues had previously been analyzed for other 3CL pro enzymes using molecular dynamics by Paasche et al. (2014) , who arrived at the conclusion that the most likely resting state consists of Cys145 and both histidines being neutral, while the zwitterionic state was proposed to consist of charged Cys145 and His41 with a neutral His164. At variance with this proposal, the putative protonation state of the neutron-based model assumes that both histidines are charged at the nominal crystallization pH of 6.6. This interpretation, however, would require the catalytic Wat409 to be the acceptor of three hydrogen bonds (from the N 1 atoms of the two histidine residues and from the main-chain amide of His41), while both D atoms of this heavy water molecule would form deuterium bonds to O 2 of Asp187. Such an arrangement is rather unlikely and considering that the nuclear density for Wat409 is quite featureless, whereas the density for D 1 of His41 is lower than that for D \"2 , one could postulate that Wat409 could be rotated. In the new arrangement this D 2 O molecule would become a hydrogen donor to both Asp187 and His41, thus better satisfying the tetrahedral arrangement of hydrogen bonds expected around a water molecule. Although not directly supported by the observed nuclear density for Wat409, such an interpretation would not disagree with it. Double protonation of His164 is much better supported by the nuclear density map, although one cannot exclude the possibility of the N \"2 atom being an acceptor of the deuteron from the hydroxyl group of Thr175. At this stage the exact charge state of the active site of the enzyme still requires additional data to be verified.",

This water molecule is located about 8 \u00c5 from Cys145 and is usually hydrogen-bonded to the peptide N atom of His41 and the N 1 atoms of His41 and His164. Inspection of the hydrogen-bonding pattern of His41 and His164 is quite suggestive of the most probable rotamers of their side chains, in spite of the fact that insufficient data resolution may not permit an unambiguous decision based on the distribution of B factors and/or covalent geometry (Malinska et al., 2015) . The principle of satisfactory hydrogen-bonding patterns requires such histidine rotamers in which their N atoms are involved in optimized hydrogen bonds; however, in many PDB models of 3CL pro these rotamers are inverted (despite validation alerts almost always flagging the required flips) and the catalytic water is in hydrogen-bonding contact with the C 2 atoms of one or both of the histidine rings.

Whereas all molecules A in these structures are similar to the average model, molecules B exhibit a different domain orientation. When molecules A and B from the P2 1 _a crystals are superposed on their N-terminal domains (residues 1-197), the polar rotation necessary to bring the smaller C-terminal domains (residues 198-306) into alignment is 18.0, 18.2, 22.4, 17.2 and 20.3 , respectively, with the hinge in the vicinity of Asp197. This significant domain rearrangement is likely to be caused by specific crystal-packing requirements. The difference in the mutual orientation of the domains is illustrated in Fig. 9 .",

(2020) observed that in their structure with PDB code 7khp, in molecule B, representing the acyl-enzyme complex bound in the active site, the widening of the substrate-binding groove (measured as the shift of residues Gln189 and Leu167 away from each other) could be estimated as 1.5 \u00c5 relative to their structure of the free enzyme with PDB code 7jp1 or to the highest resolution structure (PDB entry 6yb7). We have compared the width of this structural region (which consists of two -strands) in all molecules listed in Tables 1 and 2, taking into account three distances between C -atom pairs facing each other on the two -strands at the opposing sides of the groove: 164-187, 166-189 and 168-191 . The results are summarized in Table 5 , revealing some flexibility of the protein chains along the active-site groove. This effect is reflected in the variation (measured as r.m.s.d.) of the interstrand distances, which increases from the pair of residues 164-187, where it is 0.24 \u00c5 , towards the pair 168-191, which is farther away from the active-site reaction center and where this value exceeds 1 \u00c5 . In addition, the stretching of the 187-191 distance is slightly more variable than that of 164-168. This result is corroborated by the scatter of the C coordinates around the average positions (Table 5 ). This behavior is the same in both the apo forms and the inhibitor complexes. Therefore, the particular situation noted by Lee et al. (2020) for just one pair of molecules cannot be given universal validity.",

It is of pivotal importance that the models were not blindly accepted as raw material from the PDB, but were instead first collected in a dedicated database (https://covid-19.bioreproducibility.org), where they underwent thorough checking, validation and, if necessary, re-refinement and redeposition in the PDB. The lessons from this large-scale meta-analysis are manifold. Firstly, they caution against the overinterpretation of small structural changes detected by biocrystallography as being of unequivocal biological significance. We have seen that such changes related to inhibitors or mutations can be masked by even larger changes caused by crystal packing. This is pointedly illustrated by a heatmap of geometrical variability of the 3CL pro molecules, where the ligand-free and inhibitor complexes do not segregate but form other clusters together. Also, the expectation that room temperature will reveal features that are lost at 100 K is not supported by our results. Thus, we do not see much merit in forcing unusual experimental conditions (for example XFEL radiation) when a more mundane approach would be sufficient. In contrast, techniques such as neutron scattering are invaluable in providing new information. This study would not be possible without the PDB, which has been the chief custodian of biostructural data for 50 years and one of the major driving forces that has enabled the tremendous advances in structural biology in recent decades. The PDB is continuously evolving, and in the last several years it has introduced crucial new functionalities into the validation pipeline. We find particularly important the tools focused on ligand quality and the ongoing implementation of PDB entry versioning. Nevertheless, as our experiences from this study show, there are still many possibilities for improvement that can be made to increase the quality, interpretability and reproducibility of the data gathered in the PDB. There were numerous problems with the original PDB depositions analyzed here. They include a lack of definition of ligand restraints, wrong or inconsistent ligand stereochemistry and nomenclature, poor differentiation between a polymer and its ligand, inconsistent treatment of ADPs etc. A separate problem, requiring an institutional solution, is the flooding of the PDB with depositions from ligand-screening campaigns such as PanDDA, which are not quite on a par with the rest of the database. While potentially useful for the intended purpose of fragment screening, these entries have inferior refinement status, model completeness and ligand quality metrics. Being incompatible with the conventional deposition standards, the provided maps are impossible to reproduce even with the best of intentions. In our opinion PanDDA data should be archived in a dedicated repository, more akin to a raw data bank, with the single data set containing the ligand deposited unaltered and clearly identified. Finally, our analysis detected, and hopefully corrected, numerous errors in the individual depositions. Apart from a lax approach to crystallographic conventions, there is the minor but annoying problem of placing the model all over the place in the unit cell (and outside). A simple run of ACHESYM at an early stage of structure solution should put everything on a common footing. In a number of cases there were problems with modeling of the protein portion, especially with side-chain rotamers. Even more troubling from the point of view of medical significance are modeling errors of the inhibitors, sometimes caused by wishful thinking not supported by experimental electron density. Overall, however, the problem of data misinterpretation or overinterpretation was less severe in this project than in several other structure-validation campaigns.",

(i) Do not uncritically assume that the important ligand/inhibitor or other significant part of the structure deposited in the PDB is correctly modeled. Always check whether the experimental electron density is consistent with the proposed ligand conformation or look for external validation results in a dedicated database (for example, https://covid-19.bioreproducibility.org). (ii) Use graphical software for visual inspection of crucial ligand properties, such as stereochemistry or chirality. (iii) Verify ligand occupancy/ADP parameters; be alerted if the former are too low (<0.5) or the latter are too high (>80 \u00c5 2 ). (iv) Do not uncritically assume that the modeled proton distribution in the active site is correct; X-ray diffraction is very poor in this respect, and even neutron diffraction results may be questionable. (v) We also point out that even the most conserved catalytic water molecule is missing in a number of models despite the presence of unambiguous electron density: a clear warning to those who might use these models for tasks such as drug design.",

            "text": "Viewing the problems encountered during this work in a constructive way, we would like to make a number of recommendations for improvement of the procedures implemented by the PDB. Firstly, although the PDB site shows the overall quality percentiles of a structure, they are not available as advanced search criteria. Having these metrics directly in the search tool would enable selection of the best structure when there are many entries for the same protein. Secondly, ligand quality indicators (for example RSR and RSCC) could be introduced as sliders for major ligands (for example those over five atoms) on PDB entry pages and as advanced search criteria in order to highlight potential problems with ligand modeling prior to inspection of full validation reports. Thirdly, these and other quality metrics, such as R and R free , are values that should be fully reproducible. Currently, different values of these metrics are obtained from the PDB, from the primary citation and when trying to reproduce results. If a deposition was accompanied by a detailed description of the computational protocol used by the PDB when processing the data, this would greatly improve reproducibility. Fourthly, the PDB validation pipeline is currently focused on the correctness of what is in the model, but does not check for what may be missing. Adding to the validation report a gallery of screenshots of up to ten difference electron-density peaks above 5 r.m.s.d., in the same way as the electron-density fit for ligands is currently displayed, would be an excellent way of attracting the attention of both the depositors and the PDB consumers. Fifthly, as this work was focused on comparing homologous structures, we had to constantly standardize the placement of models in the unit cell and sometimes even reindex the structure factors. Although it cannot be expected that all homologous structures will always be instantly comparable, the PDB could promote (or even add to OneDep) a tool such as ACHESYM (http://achesym.ibch.poznan.pl/) that would make structural comparisons easier. Sixthly, since, as described above, the purpose and results of PanDDA campaigns are not directly compatible with standard PDB depositions, we suggest archiving PanDDA group depositions in a separate vault, where they could be compared with other fragment-screening campaigns, similarly to what is performed at https://fragalysis.diamond.ac.uk/. Finally, we would like to stress that the only way forward is to nudge the original authors to deposit prudently refined structures and to correct them when necessary. The latter aspect is greatly facilitated by the recently enabled PDB entry versioning. As the final conclusion, let us reiterate the importance of validated structural information in biomedical research (Waman et al., 2020) and express hope that this analysis, conducted under the medical threat of COVID-19, will set a useful example in the case of other health emergencies.",
