[4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] However, contact tracing is particularly complicated when there are many clusters of cases, 10 11 and the effectiveness of implementing critical response strategies, such as contact tracing, diminishes when there is widespread community transmission. In such a scenario, population-level adoption of protective behaviours is required to limit community transmission, in addition to biomedical interventions, such as vaccines and therapeutics. 2 In this paper, we draw from the emerging evidence on behaviour adoption during diverse public health emergencies in developing a contextual framework that aims to facilitate a common taxonomy of behaviour adoption approaches. We use the COVID-19 pandemic as an illustrative case study for the application of the contextual framework. As the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic and prepares to respond to (re)emerging public health threats, our contextual framework can inform the design, implementation, tracking and evaluation of comprehensive PHSMs and behaviour adoption interventions during health emergencies.",

[12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] The public's voluntary change in avoidance behaviour (eg, spending more time at home) during the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 epidemic in the USA has been measured by combining data on how people spent their time with epidemiological data that accounted for the potential confounding effect of extreme weather conditions. 12 The findings indicate that voluntary adoption of avoidance behaviours contributed substantially to reducing the attack rate. During the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Hong Kong, frequent hand washing and increased use of face masks by the general public helped control the epidemic and prevented the flare-up of new clusters. 13 14 A systematic review showed that frequent hand washing during this epidemic was maintained for 22 months after the initial outbreaks in North America, Mainland China and Hong Kong. 18 The key behavioural drivers of containing the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea were population-level improvements in the timeliness of seeking medical care for suspected Ebola cases and avoiding unsafe physical contact with suspected patients with Ebola and bodies during traditional burial practices. 15-17 19 We have further summarised the drivers of behaviours during past health emergencies (online supplemental material). Despite the differences in sociodemographic settings, the collective evidence demonstrates the need for clear, science-based messaging during infectious disease epidemics to help the public channel anxieties and fears into protective health behaviours, and to build trust in public health measures. This includes effective communication on the current state of knowledge regarding the outbreak, as well as the practical and actionable measures that people can take to mitigate transmission risk. The PHSMs should (1) be informed by behavioural insights data, (2) be coupled with localised two-way interpersonal communication and community engagement approaches that build on existing trusted networks and (3) address community concerns and needs.",

For each behaviour, we draw examples from a combination of interventions in the COVID-19 response, coupled with other illustrative evidence on behaviour change interventions in routine public health programmes or from past global health emergencies, including epidemics of Ebola, influenza A/H1N1 and SARS. We developed a contextual framework to highlight how these three approaches differ considerably in terms of their implementation and underlying drivers of action, as well as enforcement, reach and uptake (figure 1). Effective communication should be a crosscutting feature to enable behaviour adoption in all three approaches. Similarly, transparency and accountability in addressing issues of equity should also be cross-cutting features of all three approaches. 20 Top-down approaches During the COVID-19 pandemic, top-down approaches to achieve behaviour adoption have garnered the most attention, featuring measures such as border closures, school closures and other government-instituted 'lockdowns' that create population-level restriction of movements, in addition to mandates for wearing masks in public spaces. 4 21-24 There have been numerous ongoing efforts to track the global implementation of PHSMs since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The WHO has developed a harmonised dataset to combine various tracked PHSM data under a common taxonomy. 25 Our descriptive analysis of the publicly available dataset show that every WHO member state has implemented one or more PHSM and a total of 48 795 instances of PHSMs have been documented across 228 countries and territories between January and December 2020. Nearly half of the instances of implemented PHSMs were most closely aligned with top-down approaches related to social and physical distancing measures (table 2) .",

            "text": "Emerging evidence suggests that the stringency of topdown PHSMs has partly been a reaction to the sharp increase in new daily cases. 26 27 Low-income countries with limited healthcare systems seemed to have more quickly enacted stricter top-down mitigation policies, BMJ Global Health although for shorter durations and with limited scope. 28 Early implementation of top-down measures, especially border closures and movement restrictions, may have contributed to slowing transmission in low-income countries coupled with overall reduction in the risk for severe illness and mortality due to having a much younger population than high-income countries. 28 However, the global easing and lifting of mitigation policies point to BMJ Global Health the difficulty in maintaining such policies, partly due to fatigue and socioeconomic challenges. 29 Similar to the COVID-19 pandemic, behaviour adoption measures were initially focused on top-down approaches during the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. 30 For instance, there were blanket mandates that all deaths (regardless of Ebola status) had to be reported to the governments so that corpses could be buried safely by teams trained in infection prevention and control. 31 It was mandatory to cremate corpses in the early part of the response in Liberia, causing a major rift between the communities and the government. 32 In Sierra Leone, burial teams' use of black body bags to transport corpses was perceived as culturally unacceptable by the public. 33 34 Because of the initial failure of these culturally unacceptable top-down measures, families often refused to report household deaths and chose to secretly bury their loved ones instead of adopting the safe burial process. 35 Unsafe burials propagated Ebola transmission such that each unsafe burial resulted in an average of three new Ebola cases. 36 The top-down measures regarding burials had to be rapidly modified to integrate cultural and religious rites in a safe manner. 33 Eventually, bottom-up community engagement was required to increase and sustain community acceptance of safe burial measures during the Ebola epidemic. 37 Intermediary approaches Intermediary approaches use institutional and organisational policies to reinforce the protective behaviours in elevated risk settings. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the provision of handwashing stations (or alcohol-based hand rubs) at the entrance of restaurants and businesses provides a cue to action for people to practice proper hand hygiene. 38 In healthcare settings, providing all patients, visitors and service providers with a mask as they enter facilities helps to ensure universal use of masks in these elevated-risk settings. In routine healthcare settings, displaying visual cues that remind providers to wash their hands has been helpful for patients who try to ensure providers' compliance. 39 Meanwhile, commercial entities (eg, banks) have reconfigured physical spaces in waiting areas to foster appropriate social distancing. 40 Intermediary approaches may be considered as negotiated forms of behavioural adoption that respect individual's autonomy to weigh their need for access (eg, to banks, schools, places of worship, restaurants, airports, etc) against their willingness to comply with the risk mitigation BMJ Global Health measures to gain access to elevated-risk settings. A major strength of intermediary approaches is their potential to 'nudge' the behaviour via the provision of physical and social cues without needing to always overtly enforce the behaviour to realise high uptake. 41 Given that intermediary approaches operate across important community institutions, they can be powerful in promoting key protective behaviours and providing continuity of uptake within communities. People may be more willing to calibrate how they should behave based on expectations set by local institutions that they value and trust. Such a negotiated form of behaviour adoption renders the local institutions as important gatekeepers of behaviours in elevated-risk settings. Therefore, in responding to health emergencies, public health entities should partner with and support local institutions with their interpretation and implementation of the available evidence on risk mitigation.",

Voluntary behaviour adoption via bottom-up approaches can be partly explained through psychological constructs, such as social learning and self-efficacy. 38 Although bottom-up approaches are often facilitated by entities that may be outside of the community, an important feature is the focus on listening to communities, working with them to develop local actions, and including them in the overall public health response. Even without outside facilitation, communities can also independently develop local solutions based on local assets and experiences. It should be noted that bottom-up approaches can take various forms, including the leveraging of social influence and grassroots persuasion principles, even if led by a governmental authority. An example of this during the COVID-19 pandemic is the MaskUp! Campaign spearheaded by a local mayor in Houston, Texas, USA to model the use of facemasks and educate the community on why, when, where and how to use facemasks. 42 It is also an example of how a top-down measure (mandating of masks by the Texas governor) can be supported through bottom-up approaches (social influence campaign by Houston's mayor).",

It has been documented that adolescents might perceive the lack of in-person social interactions as particularly challenging due to public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. 44 The strategic use of social media influencers could be an effective way to foster peer-led outreach among adolescents to promote the uptake of protective behaviours and increased support for testing. In the United Kingdom, the government actively works with social media influencers to promote getting tested for COVID-19, especially among adolescents. 45 Despite the availability of country-specific examples of bottom-up approaches, the WHO global dataset of PHSMs show that bottom-up approaches have constituted a very small fraction of PHSMs implemented globally during the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately 7% of the tracked instances of PHSMs globally were related to communication and public engagement efforts (table 2) . It should be noted, however, that the communication and engagement efforts documented in the WHO PHSM dataset have mainly constituted one-way information dissemination efforts via mass media and webbased channels; they were rarely reflective of bottom-up, participatory approaches to engage communities on the protective behaviours. 25 In other health emergency contexts, community engagement efforts with trusted and influential community members have been used to promote protective behaviours. 19 For instance, during the 2014-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, large-scale community engagement interventions were implemented by thousands of faith leaders, traditional leaders, influential women leaders and other trusted community members; they worked together to locally interpret top-down measures and ensure that they were appropriate for their communities; then they promoted and modelled the protective behaviours in their communities. 19 30 In Sierra Leone, structured community engagement interventions supported locally owned community action plans that addressed unmet needs for sustained behaviour adoption. 30 46 The emerging evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic, past health emergencies and established theories explaining human behaviour, all point to the need for more innovative, bottom-up approaches that engage trusted community members to communicate the benefits of the protective behaviours and support communities to develop action plans based on their local circumstances, means and strengths.",

These standards followed on from the Communication for Behavioural Impact (COMBI) toolkit for behavioural and social communication in outbreak response developed by the WHO, UNICEF and global stakeholders. 48 COMBI stresses that 'each outbreak is unique, and community understanding of diseases and their spread is complex, context dependent, and culturally-mediated'.",

A prime example of how a blended approach can be achieved is Taiwan's open consultation platform (vTaiwan); it brought together stakeholders (using online and offline platforms) from the government, civil society and private sector to propose, discuss, reflect and legislate; this platform had been in use for a range of issues prior to COVID-19. 42 Such an approach could also be leveraged for responding to COVID-19 and illuminates the potential for innovative thinking to blend all three approaches into a unified platform to facilitate collective action. Effective communication should be an important feature across all approaches, especially in the context of the complexities posed by emerging 'infodemic' fuelled by fake news and misinformation campaigns. 49 It is critical to have ongoing and credible communication to inform the public about what is known (and unknown) to gain and sustain the public's confidence in the emergency response while responding to the infodemic at the same time; this would enable the public to effectively make decisions on how to best protect themselves, their families and their communities. 50 ",
