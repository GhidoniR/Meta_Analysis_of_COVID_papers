            "text": "Exoskeletons that assist the hip, knee, and ankle joints have begun to improve human mobility, particularly by reducing the metabolic cost of walking. However, direct comparisons of optimal assistance of these joints, or their combinations, have not yet been possible. Assisting multiple joints may be more beneficial than the sum of individual effects, because muscles often span multiple joints, or less effective, because single-joint assistance can indirectly aid other joints. In this study, we used a hip-knee-ankle exoskeleton emulator paired with human-in-theloop optimization to find single-joint, two-joint, and whole-leg assistance that maximally reduced the metabolic cost of walking for three participants. Hip-only and ankle-only assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 26% and 30% relative to walking in the device unassisted, confirming that both joints are good targets for assistance. Knee-only assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 13%, demonstrating that effective knee assistance is possible. Two-joint assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking by between 34% and 42%, with the largest improvements coming from hip-ankle assistance. Assisting all three joints reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 50%, showing that at least half of the metabolic energy expended during walking can be saved through exoskeleton assistance. Changes in kinematics and muscle activity indicate that single-joint assistance indirectly assisted muscles at other joints, such that the improvement from whole-leg assistance was smaller than the sum of its single-joint parts. Exoskeletons can assist the entire limb for maximum effect, but a single wellchosen joint can be more efficient when considering additional factors such as weight and cost.",

These devices have the potential to restore ambulatory ability lost from age or disability, and increase maximum performance for high-activity users like first responders, military personnel, or athletes. One important way exoskeletons can help is by reducing the metabolic cost of walking, which is the amount of biochemical energy consumed to produce walking at a given speed (1) . Humans tend to move in ways that minimize metabolic cost (2) (3) (4) (5) , indicating its importance. Reducing the metabolic cost of walking is considered the gold standard for evaluating exoskeletons (6, 7). By reducing metabolic cost, exoskeletons could help achieve related mobility outcomes like increasing the user's walking speed or decreasing fatigue.",

Reductions in metabolic cost have been demonstrated from assisting one or two joints (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) , with the largest metabolic cost reduction being around 18% relative to walking in no exoskeleton (14, 17) and 24% relative to walking in an exoskeleton with no torques applied (12) . Despite demonstrated improvements, exoskeletons are in a nascent stage of commercial development, and widespread adoption has not yet occurred (6) . To promote adoption, devices may need larger improvements that offset the negative impacts of exoskeletons, such as worn mass, bulkiness, or cost. Wearing a device imposes a metabolic penalty from added mass which could eliminate small benefits. Users may not be able to sense if the exoskeleton is assisting them because the largest improvements in the field are similar to the just-noticeable difference for metabolic cost (around 20%) (20) . Improving our scientific and engineering understanding of exoskeleton assistance could deliver larger benefits that may lead to widespread adoption of these devices.",

A large portion of human leg musculature is biarticular (30) , comprising muscles that span two joints. Biarticular muscles might be more effectively assisted by multijoint exoskeletons, leading to a total benefit beyond the sum of assisting each joint individually. Some experiments have suggested that multi-joint assistance might be more effective than single-joint assistance (16, 31) . Alternatively, adding assistance at other joints may have diminishing returns. Users might adapt their walking pattern to maximize the benefit from assistance at a single-joint, thereby indirectly benefiting muscles at other joints, which may make it relatively less effective to assist additional joints. Some experiments have shown indications of such indirect assistance (32, 33) . A well-controlled comparison allowing observations of how users respond to different types of assistance would help us to develop improved models of biomechanical and neural adaptation to exoskeletons.",

For all conditions, the algorithm minimized the measured metabolic cost of walking at 1.25 m/s. Two participants had previous experience in the exoskeleton, and the third completed a lengthy training protocol before optimization (Sup. Note 1). . Metabolic cost of walking was calculated by subtracting out quiet standing. The percent reduction relative to walking with no torque is shown above each bar.

To evaluate the metabolic cost of walking, we subtracted the metabolic cost of standing quietly (1.55 W/kg on average, Sup. Note 2) from the metabolic cost measured in each walking trial. The metabolic cost of walking without wearing the exoskeleton was 2.91 W/kg on average. The cost of walking in the exoskeleton with no torque applied was 3.70 W/kg on average, which was higher than the no-exoskeleton condition because of the added mass and impedance to the user. Percent reductions in metabolic cost were calculated in comparison to this no-torque condition to assess the effect of the designed torque assistance specifically, allowing for best comparisons between assistance conditions. Single-joint assistance at each joint reduced metabolic cost, with the largest improvements coming from the ankles and hips. Hip-only assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 26% relative to walking with no torque (N = 3, range of reductions: 24% -30%, p = 0.005). Knee-only assistance reduced metabolic cost for each participant, with an average reduction of 13% relative to walking with no torque, although this was not statistically significant (N = 3, range of reductions: 5% -18%, p = 0.07). Ankle-only assistance performed best of the single-joint strategies, reducing metabolic cost by 30% relative to walking with no torque (N = 3, range of reductions: 28% -31%, p = 0.004). When assisting a single joint, exoskeleton designers should consider the ankles or the hips. Two-joint assistance outperformed single-joint assistance. Two-joint assistance reduced metabolic cost of walking relative to no torque by 42%, 35%, and 34% for hip-ankle, knee-ankle and hip-knee assistance, respectively (N = 1, Sup. Note 3). Hip-ankle assistance provided the most benefit, mirroring single-joint reductions and aligning with expectations based on biological power. Whole-leg exoskeleton assistance led to the greatest reductions in metabolic cost of any condition. Whole-leg assis-tance (hips, knees, and ankles simultaneously) reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 50% relative to walking with no torque (N = 3, range of reductions: 46% -53%, p = 0.02), corresponding to a reduction of 37% relative to walking without wearing the exoskeleton (N = 3, range of reductions: 34% -41%, p = 0.02). This shows that about half of the metabolic energy expended during walking can be saved through exoskeleton assistance, and suggests that whole-leg assistance could provide large net benefits in untethered systems, even after accounting for the effects of added mass.",

Optimized torque magnitudes were smaller than biological torques, with peak exoskeleton torques ranging from about 15% to 60% of biological peaks. Ankle torque magnitudes were largest and optimized to the comfort-limited parameter constraints in all but one case. The timing of the optimized assistance only partially aligned with biological torque. For example, the peak of optimal hip flexion assistance occurred later than peak biological flexion torque. Sometimes, assistance torque opposed typical biological torques. For example, knee flexion assistance around 60% of stride opposed biological knee extension torque for normal walking. These optimized magnitudes indicate the design requirements for mobile devices and show that optimized assistance is not a scaled version of biological torques. The shape and timing of optimized assistance was consistent across conditions and participants, but optimal magnitudes differed. For example, the optimal timing of peak hip extension assistance was about 11% of stride for all joint combinations and participants, while optimal magnitudes ranged from 0.3 Nm/kg (hip-ankle) to 0.5 Nm/kg (hip-knee). One exception to the consistency of optimal timing was ankle torque rise time, which was shorter during single-joint assistance, possibly due to adjustments for comfort in multi-joint condi- Optimized single-joint (single-color, dotted), two-joint (two-color, dashed) and whole-leg (blue, solid) exoskeleton assistance torques at the hips (left), knees (center), and ankles (right).

Typically, reductions in activity were seen in muscles that crossed assisted joints and acted in the same direction as assistance. For example, soleus activity decreased during all conditions that applied ankle assistance. Sometimes activity increased during opposing assistance, such as in the vastus lateralis during periods of knee flexion torque. Some reductions in muscle activity occurred during assistance at other joints. For example, gluteus maximus activity decreased when the hip was assisted directly, but also decreased during ankle-only assistance. This is consistent with the observation that exoskeleton assistance at one joint can indirectly assist muscles that cross other joints. The indirect assistance could be from the complex dynamics of the leg during walking, or could be facilitated by the kinematic adaptations to maximize the effectiveness of each type of assistance. Optimized assistance did not cause users to eliminate muscle activity, suggesting that either some amount of activity is still useful or further advancements to control architecture would be needed to reduce energy expenditure further.",

Whole-leg assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 50% relative to walking with no torque, a substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art (17% -24%) (12, 14, 17) ) . This corresponded to a 37% reduction relative to walking with no exoskeleton, nearly double the justnoticeable difference in metabolic cost (20%) (20) , indicating that participants could feel the reduction in effort compared to walking normally. Because whole-leg assistance produced the largest benefit of all assistance conditions, exoskeleton designers who want to maximize performance should consider assisting the whole leg. Among single-joint assistance strategies, ankle-only assistance was most effective, followed closely by the hip, with smaller reductions possible at the knee. Hip and knee assistance resulted in greater metabolic cost reductions than previous lower-torque exoskeletons assisting these joints (14, 17, 18) , while ankle assistance resulted in similar improvements as found with high-torque exoskeletons and human-in-theloop optimization (12, 39) . Knee-only assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking, although the reduction was not statistically significant for our sample size and significance level. Knee-only assistance may be more effective for walking up inclines (18, 40) , considering the increased positive power requirements from the knee (41) . Devices designed to assist just one joint during level walking should target the ankle or hip, which showed reductions of 30% and 26%, respectively. With similar metabolic reductions, designers could compare between the ankle or hip based on other aspects of Average joint angle as a percentage of stride at the hips (left), knees (center), and ankles (right) for each condition. Shown here are the average for both legs across all participants (N = 3 for single-joint and whole-leg, N = 1 for two-joint). All single-joint and whole-leg conditions were tested on the same day to reduce changes in alignment between user and device. Two-joint conditions were each collected individually. For walking in the exoskeleton with no torque (black), the standard deviation of angles is shown (gray cloud) to contextualize the magnitude of changes between conditions.",

            "text": "These results suggest ways of designing better exoskeleton products. Optimized torques did not mimic biological torques, with magnitudes smaller than biological for all joints and peak torques later than biological peaks for the hips and ankles (Fig. 3) . Optimized torque magnitudes were within the range of reported capabilities of some existing mobile devices for the lightest participant (61 kg) (9, 15, 43) but not for the heaviest participant (90 kg) (28) . Exoskeletons could be designed in different sizes (e.g. small, medium, large) that meet the optimized torque magnitudes for different sized users while minimizing worn mass. The similar timing parameters across users and across assistance strategies suggest that these optimized profiles could translate well to existing devices with lower capabilities and could be generalizable to a wide range of users. Device designers could consider control strategies that allow for kinematic adaptations because they seem to be useful to maximize device effectiveness. We also recommend considering state-based control at the knees, which was more effective than pilot tests of strictly torque-time control. This strategy may have facilitated adaptation to knee extension assistance during stance, because the torques grew as the user bent more into flexion, allowing for a \"stabilizing\" effect that prevented buckling of the knee. These findings should translate well to a wholeleg mobile device because the worn mass (13.5 kg) is similar to the expected mass of a mobile device capable of the optimized torque magnitudes (10 kg) based on published torque densities (9, 11, 28, 43-48) (Sup. Note 10). These results can be used to improve our models of human coordination, especially when using assistive devices. The larger metabolic cost reductions we saw from hip and ankle assistance support the idea that the hips and ankles are primary energy consumers during walking (22) . Unlike some simulations (25) , muscle activity did not go to zero even when assisted without hitting torque limits, indicating the user is optimizing for more than just metabolic cost for an average steady-state stride. Simulations could capture that more complicated objective function, including control required for balance. These results show that kinematic adaptations to assistance are important and should be considered in simulations. This study could have been improved by testing more participants, providing additional training, or testing additional controller parameterizations. This was an extremely arduous experiment with long optimization times, with each participant completed over 50 hours of experiments. It was then interrupted by difficult external conditions (the COVID-19 pandemic). As such, we were only able to complete three participants for the single-joint and whole-leg optimizations, and one participant for the two-joint optimizations. However, given the magnitude of the changes and the consistency of the responses across participants, this sample size is sufficient to identify the efficacy of the joint combinations tested. Given three participants and a desired statistical power of 0.8, and assuming metabolic reductions have a standard deviation of 7.3% (12), we can confidently detect metabolic reductions of 24% and larger. Although we gave our users sub-stantial training and optimization time, more time may have improved the outcomes. Longitudinal studies with mobile devices that can be worn daily could show greater improvements to walking as users adapt. Torques optimized to the comfort-based limits at the ankles, which were set due to discomfort at the biological ankle joint, possibly from extending the ankles too quickly or too far during torque application at push-off. Using a more sophisticated control approach to ensure user comfort while allowing the largest possible exoskeleton torques might also lead to larger benefits. These results suggest that new cost functions, gait environments, and user populations could be exciting topics for future studies. Future work could optimize metabolic cost alongside other costs that are important for gait, such as walking speed, balance, or user satisfaction (49) . Our study did not penalize high torques or powers, but future work could try to maintain sufficient metabolic cost reductions while minimizing actuator requirements, which can be costly to mobile devices. While our study assisted walking at a fixed speed on level-ground, future work can explore optimized assistance for walking in different conditions such as at different speeds, on inclines, or with worn loads. Our study was restricted to a treadmill due to our tethered device, but this work could be extended to unstructured environments by translating the paradigm to mobile devices. Our findings for assisting young, able-bodied users could be a starting point to optimize assistance for older adults and people with disabilities, hopefully speeding the discovery of effective assistance strategies. 12) . With three participants, the 50% reduction detected from whole-leg assistance has a statistical power of 0.999.",

First, we optimized single-joint assistance for all three users in the order of ankle-only, hip-only, and then knee-only assistance. We then optimized whole-leg assistance for all three users, meaning we optimized assistance of the hip, knee and ankle simultaneously. Finally, for one user (P1), we optimized two-joint assistance, in the order of hip-ankle, knee-ankle, and hip-knee assistance. After optimization, we performed validation experiments to compare the optimized assistance to the control conditions of walking without the exoskeleton, and walking in the exoskeleton with no torque applied.

When the desired torque is zero, the exoskeleton tracks the user's joint angles and applies no torques. During walking, we define these desired torque profiles as a function of percent stride. We consider heel strike, measured by ground reaction forces in the treadmill, to be the start of a stride. We calculate percent stride as the time since heel strike divided by the average stride time over the past 20 strides. The hip profile starts 84% of stride after heel strike because hip extension torque is active during heel strike. Resetting the hips' stride time at heel strike caused discrete jumps in hip extension torque during pilot testing. The desired torque profile for each joint is made up of a spline (piecewise cubic hermite interpolating polynomial) anchored by nodes. Each node can be set in advance by an operator, or it can be updated in real time by an algorithm. For the knees, torque was also commanded as a function of joint state. Along with a torque-time profile, knee torque had one spring-like phase during stance, and one damping-like phase during late swing. Our exoskeleton accurately applied desired torques using closed-loop proportional control with iterative learning and joint-velocity compensation (28, 50) . Root-mean-square (RMS) error for tracking desired torques was 0.6 Nm at the hips, 3.0 Nm at the knees, and 0.4 Nm at the ankles during whole-leg assistance (Sup. Note 13). Error was highest at the knees because the state-based control allowed for discontinuous jumps in desired torque that were not possible for our device to track, and the desired torque would change step to step making it harder to track. When zero torque was commanded it was realized effectively, with an RMS applied torque of less than 1 Nm.",

The damping period was defined in a similar way to knee stiffness, with optimization of the onset timing, the damping coefficient, and the offset timing.

To ensure large torques weren't applied too late in the stride, torque was set to be zero by 65% of stride, so if peak time optimized to it's latest allowed value (55% of stride), the fall time would be set to the minimum allowed fall time (10% of stride).",

Note 11). For whole-leg assistance for P3, the optimization was restarted because the user had an abnormally high stride frequency that had high metabolic cost, indicating a maladaptation to assistance similar to some users in a previous optimization study.

Finally, the two-joint assistance strategies were validated after each optimization. After each optimization was completed, a validation experiment was used to accurately assess the metabolic cost of walking and calculate the percent reduction. This collection was on a separate day, before optimization of the next assistance strategy began. Users walked in longer bouts for the exoskeleton conditions to ensure accurate measurements of steady-state metabolics and to ensure users were adapted to the device and assistance. We recorded the user standing quietly for 6 minutes, walking without the exoskeleton for 6 minutes, walking in the exoskeleton with no torque applied for 10 minutes, and walking with the optimized assistance torques for 20 minutes, in a double-reversed order (ABCDD-CBA). This order was not randomized due to the time it takes to get in and out of the exoskeleton, as well as to maximize acclamation to the device by presenting progressively more novel conditions. Users rested for at least three minutes between walking conditions, and at least five minutes before a quiet standing condition, to ensure their metabolics returned to baseline. For the no exoskeleton condition, users wore the same brand and model of boots that are included in the exoskeleton (McRae 8189) . After all single-joint and whole-leg optimizations were completed, we evaluated all these optimized strategies in one data collection to directly compare conditions. We measured applied torque, kinematics, muscle activity, power, and vertical ground reaction forces. For this validation, we recorded the user standing quietly for six minutes, walking without the exoskeleton for six minutes, walking in the exoskeleton with no torque applied for ten minutes, and then walking for ten minutes in each of the four optimized assistance conditions (hiponly, knee-only, ankle-only, whole-leg) in a random order, and then the no torque, no exoskeleton, and quiet standing conditions a second time (ABCDEFGCBA). For the one user who completed optimization of two-joint assistance, a validation day was completed after each optimization similar to the protocol following the single-joint and whole-leg optimizations. We recorded the user standing quietly for six minutes, walking without the exoskeleton for six minutes, walking in the exoskeleton with no torque applied for ten minutes, and walking with the optimized assistance torques for 20 minutes, in a double-reversed order (ABCDD-CBA), so each condition was evaluated twice.

Average metabolic cost was calculated for each condition using the last three minutes for quiet standing and walking with no exoskeleton, and using the last five minutes for walking with no torque and walking with optimized assistance.

We applied a 3rd order bandpass filter of 40 to 450 Hz, rectified, then applied a 3rd order low pass filter of 10 Hz (56). Muscle activity was averaged for a stride over the last five minutes of the device conditions and over the last three minutes for the no device conditions. We subtracted the baseline noise offset then normalized to the maximum of the no torque condition profile. The sensor locations are similar to the protocol of previous gait analysis experiments (21) with adjustments to avoid interfering with the device structure and straps.",
