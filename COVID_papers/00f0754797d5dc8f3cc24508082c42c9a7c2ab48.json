Possibility of aerosolization of the virus after sudden release of trocar valves, through non-airtight exchange of instruments, by gas leak through the extraction incision site and through surgical plume has reduced the popularity of laparoscopy during the pandemic [5] . However, the benefits of laparoscopic surgery, such as decreased pain scores, early mobilization and decreased post-operative pulmonary complications, reduce hospital stay and thus reduce the possibility of in-house infection and increase the hospital turnover. Using enclosures which have suction devices, such as those mentioned by Cubillos, could help circumvent these risk factors, by allowing continuous elimination of infective aerosols [2] . Restarting laparoscopic and day care procedures may well be the key",
