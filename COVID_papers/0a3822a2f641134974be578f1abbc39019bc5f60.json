Most of the metagenomic and metatranscriptomics studies are focused on cancers from the gastrointestinal tract [35] , or skin [36] , or head/neck regions [37] . However, the presence of microorganisms and BAVT in the female upper genital tract has recently been reported [11, 12, 34] . These studies not only have demonstrated the existence of microorganism in the female genital tract, but also have observed that components of this ecosystem gradually change from the vagina to the peritoneal fluid [12] . Also, there were differences in the composition of transcripts found in these areas which showed genes involved in metabolism, replication and repair, membrane transport, and drug resistance in upper areas, whereas in the lower areas predominated genes were involved in translation, energy metabolism, and cofactors and vitamins metabolism. Though vaginal specimens were well represented, there were few samples from the upper tract and that limited the scope and generalizability of their conclusions [12] . With the present study we add further evidence of the presence of BAVT in the upper genital tract in normal and cancer samples from patients. Further, we found genetic copies of bacterial, archaea, and viral DNA in benign fallopian tube samples. It must be noted that in our study all samples were obtained during surgery, so they were collected under clean conditions. We do not completely understand the origin of these BAVT, but we have determined that there are loci in the human genome that seem to preferentially harbor genetic material from these microorganisms. We do not know as yet if they are functional or if they are transcribed. BAVTs could potentially originate partially from normal genital tract flora and partially from inserted microbial genetic material. Some of the BAVT that were significant in the univariate analysis had no reciprocal DNA copy in the genome of the tube, supporting the idea of external BAVT production.",

BAVT expressions in the normal tissue were the highest and were decreased in EEC and even more in HGSC samples. Moreover, potentially, BAVTs could originate from the host genome and from normal flora within the genital tract. The balance between both sources could determine the quantity of transcript present, and that could turn out to be vital in modulating the risk of cancer. Any condition that alters this balance may also influence specific cancer risks or may modulate a variety of genomic features that may affect tumor heterogeneity. For example, in epidemiological studies it has been observed that tubal ligation, that usually blocks tubal lumen and passage, decreases the risk for ovarian cancer [42, 43] . Also, endometriosis has been postulated as a risk factor for ovarian cancer [44, 45] . Inflammation due to tubal endometriosis is a known factor involved in ovarian cancer carcinogenesis, mainly through DNA mutation mediated by free radicals associated with inflammatory process [46] . Further alteration of the microenvironment through microbiome and BAVT dysregulation may be synergistic or inhibitory of these mechanisms. Another example is the use of powdered talc in the genital area. This chemical may alter the microenvironment subsequently elevating the risk of cancer [47] . Finally, in observational studies patients with ovarian cancer or predisposition for ovarian cancer (germline BRCA1 mutation) were associated with a specific microbiome in the vagina/cervix [48] . Further studies are needed to identify the exact origin of these BAVT (host or microorganisms), the balance that is needed for organ homeostasis, and the unbalance that may lead to alterations.",

            "text": "Significant BAVT in multivariate analysis comparing normal tube versus HGSC were correlated with gene expression and expression of some regulatory lncRNAs. In the pathway analysis, these associated genes seem to play a role in pathways of infection and intracellular signaling which also are important in cancer genesis [49] . IFNA21 is one of the genes correlated with BAVT and is a member of the alpha interferon gene cluster that are produced in response to viral infection. Similarly, IFNA21 is an important component of the PI3K-AKT/mTOR pathway and was significantly correlated with the lncRNA AL163541.1, which in turn is significantly associated with the presence of Orgyia pseudotsugata transcripts. Also, IFNA21, as part of the alpha interferon gene cluster, mediates the immune response and interfere with viral replication. It has been observed that deletions of chromosome 9 short arm, which harbors a cluster of these interferon genes, may occur in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and in gliomas. Deletions are observed in lower frequency in lymphomas, melanomas, lung cancers, and other solid tumors [50] . ITGA3 has been implicated in the infectivity and associated signaling pathways in Kaposi's sarcomaassociated herpesvirus HHV-8 entry into target cells [51] . JAK1 is one of the components of the PI3K-Akt signaling and JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways. The PI3K-AKT/mTOR pathway has a critical malignant transformation of human tumors [52] and, specifically, is one of the major pathways that is aberrantly activated in ovarian cancer and associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in patients with ovarian cancer [53] . This pathway is a potential target for new therapeutic agents [54] . PI3K-AKT/mTOR pathway is downregulated by PTEN, a tumor suppressor. Mutations in PTEN are the most frequent genetic alteration in endometrial cancer [55] . In cell cultures, PTEN mutated cells seem to be more sensitive to poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors [55] . Some viral infections, like SARS-CoV2, also seem to hyperactivate the JAK1/2-STAT1 signaling system, especially in critical patients [56] . The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been known to play a predominant role in many types of human cancers, promoting invasiveness and metastasis of ovarian cancer cultured cells. Interestingly, these effects may be mediated by PARP-1 [57] . Finally, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) modulate the antitumoral activity of immune cells. However, long-term exposure of ovarian cancer cells to TKIs may reduce the responsiveness to treatment [58] . Anti-EGFR TKIs may help modulate that resistance with promising results in colon cancer [59] . Pathway analyses could inform how genes correlated with BAVT are associated with signaling pathways. However, we need functional analysis to better understand how BAVTs influence signaling pathways, like JAK/STAT and PI3K-AKT/mTOR. Even more importantly, functional analysis could better inform whether changes in BAVT expression could help in the selection of targeted therapies, like: JAK inhibitors to target the JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway [53] , or mTOR inhibitors [54] , PARP inhibitors to target HGF-mediated activation in ovarian cancer [57] or PTEN-mutated cells in endometrial cancer [55] , and double TKIs therapy to counteract EGFR TKI resistance in endometrial cancer [59] .",

Thus, despite statistical significance in the association between BAVTs and cancer and correlation with gene regulation, these results will have to be examined and validated mechanistically. Likewise, it is difficult to determine the exact origin of BAVT expression whether intrinsic (from the host) or extrinsic (by colonizing microorganisms). To better identify and quantify origins, functional analyses are needed that are beyond the scope of this study. A major strength of this study is that the data were collected at a single tertiary medical center, which ensured protocol consistency in sample collection and analysis procedures. In addition, due to the diversity of patients treated at a large tertiary medical center, the samples included in this study likely represent a broad array of the clinical phenotypes of EEC and HGSC. Despite the limited number of normal fallopian tube control samples, tubal RNA-seq analysis findings were validated by determinations of BAVT gene copies with DNA-seq of the same tubal samples. Validation of BAVTs expression comparison between EEC and HGSC was performed in the independent, well-known, and validated TCGA database. Although samples were collected in a clean environment (OR setting), contamination has been reported in laboratory instruments such as spin columns [60] . We do not believe that the results were biased due to contamination. Validation of RNA-seq results with DNA-seq determinations and with validation in an independent dataset along with independent lab processing minimizes the possibility of bias by contamination.",

Genes and lncRNAs correlated with BAVTs were associated with infectious and cancer signaling pathways. Some of these pathways associated with BAVT could inform of potential candidates for targeted therapy in future mechanistic analysis.",
