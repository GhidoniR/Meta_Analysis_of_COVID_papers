Methods: A total of 180 primary medical staff were randomly selected from seven community hospitals in Hefei Economic and Technological Development Zone as a study group. One hundred and eighty-two health people were recruited as the control group. The selfrating Anxiety Scale (SAS), self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Psychological questionnaire of public health emergencies were distributed to them for evaluation. Results: The score of SAS, SDS in study group was higher than that in control group [, P< 0.001; t=2.849, P=0.005). The fear subscale and total score in the psychological questionnaire of sudden public health events were negatively correlated with age (r=\u22120.216, P=0.004; r=\u22120.154, P=0.039). Marriage was negatively correlated with depression subscales in psychological questionnaires of SAS, SDS and sudden public health events (r=\u22120.184, P=0.013; r=\u22120.298, P<0.001; r=\u22120.161, P=0.031; r=\u22120.147, P=0.049). Education level was positively correlated with the total score of a psychological questionnaire for sudden public health events (r=0.151, P=0.043); Logistic regression analysis showed that marital status was a protective factor of psychological abnormality. Conclusion: It is necessary to pay attention to the psychological status of primary medical staff, especially the young unmarried medical staff.",

It is named \"COVID-19\" by the World Health Organization (WHO), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus strain spreads rapidly in a short time, 1,2 and the doubling time is relatively shorter than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Currently, the disease has spread to other regions of China and around the world. 3 The COVID-19 epidemic spreads very quickly and affects a large number of people. By February 15, 2020, a total of 26 countries had been affected by the epidemic, resulting in 51,857 laboratory-confirmed infections and 1669 deaths. In response to this serious situation, the WHO declared the COVID-19 epidemic a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020 and called for collaborative efforts of all countries to prevent and control its rapid spread. 4 However, the investigation from the early notification of the outbreak showed that many important information about the source of the virus and the ability to spread between the population, various clinical manifestations, treatment and epidemic characteristics is still unknown, 2 and thus the prevention and control of COVID-19 and the implementation of effective measures has great uncertainty.",

Within days, the quarantine was extended to additional provinces and cities, affecting more than 50 million people in total. 6 However, COVID-19 patients were found in almost all provinces across China in the short term. There was no doubt that the medical workforce played an indispensable role in this major public health emergency. 7 As of February 22, 2020, Anhui Province had a total of 989 confirmed cases, ranking in the top 10 in China. The primary medical staffs who are on the front line of prevention and control are under heavy work pressure and also suffer from huge psychological pressure. They feel lonely, isolated from the outside world, and unable to communicate face-to-face with their families. The pressure from all aspects cannot be effectively alleviated, making them feel more afraid and worried. 8 In the present study, we selected primary medical staff during the first-level prevention and control period in Anhui Province as the study group to evaluate the mental health status and compared them with healthy people in Hefei city, China in the same period. In addition, we also compared the mental health differences between doctors and nurses groups.",

            "text": "It has been reported that during the epidemic of influenza A (H1N1) in 2009 high-risk medical staff had a certain degree of psychological disorders, mainly manifested as emotional and sleep disorders, among which the medical staff in fever clinic were the most severe, especially at the early stage and the outbreak stage of H1N1. 10 Liu et al 11 found that there were problems with the mental health status of medical staff in military hospitals during the SARS outbreak. The scores of somatization, depression, anxiety and obsession were all increased in the psychological questionnaire evaluation, and the scores of somatization and depression were significantly increased. During the outbreak of the Ebola virus outbreak, an analysis of the psychological status of medical staff in Africa found that front-line medical staff had more prominent psychological problems in terms of compulsive behavior, interpersonal sensitivity, depressive symptoms and partial execution behaviors. 8 A study from Arab countries showed that during the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), medical staff's anxiety scores were relatively high. 12 During the outbreak of influenza A in Japan, a survey of the psychological status of 1625 medical staff showed that medical staff in high-risk departments showed varying degrees of anxiety and mental fatigue 13 . Chan et al 14 conducted a survey on the psychological status of medical staff in Singapore two months after the SARS outbreak, their results showed that approximately 20% of medical staff had stress disorders. At the same time, this psychological disorder was related to health, family relations, friends or colleagues. There is a correlation between the relationship, work, and mental appearance of the medical staff, and the emotions of medical staff after the SARS outbreak were affected and hurt to varying degrees. Not only during the epidemic outbreak, medical staff suffered severely from the stress of the epidemic, the anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms and post-traumatic stress of high-risk medical staff remained at a relatively high level for 1-2 years or more after the SARS outbreak. 15, 16 Previous studies were mostly concentrated in general hospitals and were mostly limited to cross-sectional investigations. 8, 11 The present study suggested that the mental health status of primary medical staff was lower than that of the healthy control group. Age was negatively correlated with the fear subscale and total score in the psychological questionnaire for public health emergencies; Marriage was The main reason for married people's stress might be that their work increased the risk of infection among family members. 17 At present, there are relatively fewer researches on the mental state of medical staff during the outbreak of COVID-19, and most of the related studies were in Wuhan 18, 19 or the tertiary hospitals. 20 There are few researches on the psychological changes among primary medical staff under long-term stress. As the first line of epidemic prevention and control, primary-level medical institutions need to participate in pre-examination and triage, key personnel investigation, and follow-up work of people returned from epidemic areas, fever residents and close contacts. 21 Because there is a certain gap between the medical knowledge, skills and protective equipment of the primary medical staff and the general hospital above the second level, the psychological problems may be more prominent. However, due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the questionnaire survey could only be conducted through an online platform, and the sample size is limited. In the future, further studies with a large sample size are still needed to provide a more precise reference for the psychological health interventions among primary medical staff in public health emergencies.",

Educational level was positively correlated with the total scores of psychological questionnaires for public health emergencies; these findings indicated that young and unmarried medical care groups had higher scores on the scale and worse mental health status; logistic regression analysis showed that marriage was a risk factor for psychological abnormalities. This study suggests that during the epidemic period, attention should be paid to the psychological status of primary care workers, especially young unmarried health care workers. Studies on the psychological status of and its influencing factors in health care workers (HCWs) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak indicated that married people were 1.639 times than single (OR = 1.639, 95% CI 1.355-1.922).",
