They investigated the diagnostic performance of chest computed tomography (CT) scan to detect abnormal pulmonary function test (PFT) results in 390 candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). They reported a negative predictive value of 92.9% and proposed that PFT can be replaced by chest CT scan for pretransplantation pulmonary evaluation of allo-HSCT during the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic [1] . Concerns have risen regarding the safety of performing PFT during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, as the forceful expiration required for spirometry may generate respiratory aerosol particles and mediate SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission [2, 3] . Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak pushed researchers to find tools other than PFT to evaluate pulmonary function in allo-HSCT recipients.",

They reported a sensitivity of 45.5% and a specificity of 86% for any abnormal chest CT findings. Expiratory chest CT scan is the technique of choice for identifying the presence of airway obstruction, as air trapping may be noticed on expiratory CT images of patients with apparently normal chest CT scans obtained on inspiration [5] . Thus, we recommend obtaining expiratory chest CT images in addition to an inspiratory chest CT scan for the evaluation of small airway disease before allo-HSCT if PFT is omitted as a part of the evaluation.",

Some guidelines have specifically advocated allo-HSCT as an ongoing indication for PFT during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [8] . Moreover, the role of PFT in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is uncertain and is suspected to be mostly mediated by the exposure to the spirometer and the surrounding surface, not through aerosols [8] . Consequently, we believe that PFT should continue to be included in the pre-allo-HSCT evaluation protocol during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak whenever possible. However, PFT must be performed by pulmonary function laboratories that follow strict precautions for infection control as recommended by consensus guidelines. Of particular importance pertinent to allo-HSCT recipients are proper scheduling of patient visits, universal masking, proper hand hygiene, appropriate cleansing strategies, and adequate room ventilation. It is also recommended that immunocompromised patients should be scheduled for visit at the start of a working day [8] . When an appropriate pulmonary function laboratory is not accessible, we suggest monitoring pulmonary function ",
