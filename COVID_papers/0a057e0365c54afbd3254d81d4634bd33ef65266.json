During the initial stages of the pandemic, slum residents had a significantly higher COVID-19 incidence rate than the rest of the city (8).

The cumulative incidence rate in the slums was 5916 (95% CI 5542-6289), corresponding to 13,829 people; while, in the non-slum dwellers it was 1559 (95% CI 1505-1612), corresponding to 44,314 people (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 3.79 [95% CI 3.65-3.94], p < 0.00001).A total of 25,813 people were housed in an ACS, of which 11,765 lived in a slum (5033 [95% CI 4693-5372] per 100,000 population) and 14,048 lived outside the slums (494 [95% CI 464-523] per 100,000 population). The rate of ACS use was significantly higher among the slum population (IRR 10.18 [95% CI 9.54-10.88], p < 0.00001).

In total, 31.1% (n = 18,085) of confirmed COVID-19 cases were housed in ACS. The characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and PUI are described in table 1.
