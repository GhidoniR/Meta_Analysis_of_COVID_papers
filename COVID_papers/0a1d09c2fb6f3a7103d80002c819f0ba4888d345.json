Since it has been reported that pneumonia is frequently observed in patients with scrub typhus, we investigated whether intranasal (i.n.) vaccination with the outer membrane protein of O. tsutsugamushi (OMPOT) would induce a protective immunity against O. tsutsugamushi infection. It was particular interest that when mice were infected with O. tsutsugamushi, the bacteria disseminated into the lungs, causing pneumonia. The i.n. vaccination with OMPOT induced IgG responses in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. The anti-O. tsutsugamushi IgA Abs in BAL fluid after the vaccination showed a high correlation of the protection against O. tsutsugamushi. The vaccination induced strong Ag-specific Th1 and Th17 responses in the both spleen and lungs. In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that i.n. vaccination with OMPOT elicited protective immunity against scrub typhus in mouse with O. tsutsugamushi infection causing subsequent pneumonia.",

It is characterized by fever, rash, eschar, meningitis, and pneumonitis in humans and is one of the major health problems in the Asia-Pacific region referred to as the \"tsutsugamushi triangle.\" Approximately one billion people are at risk and about 1 million cases occur each year (3) . The endemic area is extended to Siberia, Russia, the South Pacific islands, and Afghanistan (4) , and antibiotic-resistant strains have also been reported in these endemic Scrub typhus presents various clinical symptoms ranging from mild to lethal; without appropriate treatment, complications such as pneumonitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute renal failure, and meningitis can develop, often resulting in death (9) . Although O. tsutsugamushi first infects the skin, it disseminates to various organs such as the lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, brain, and lungs through blood, body fluids, and phagocytic cells (10) (11) (12) . Patients typically develop mild interstitial pneumonitis during self-resolving or promptly treated scrub typhus (13) . But, some patients with scrub typhus have shown severe pulmonary dysfunctions such as pneumonia, pleural effusion, interstitial pneumonitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), most of which are lifethreatening complications (14, 15) . However, no vaccine is available to overcome the lifethreatening lung pathologies such as ARDS and pneumonitis induced by scrub typhus.",

Although immunization via the systemic route induces relatively strong systemic immune responses, it is very weak at mucosal effector sites. In contrast, mucosal immunization can elicit effective adaptive immune responses in mucosal and systemic compartments. There is a need for developing new vaccine against scrub typhus, and mucosal immunization could be a strategy for preventing morbidity, such as pneumonia and pneumonitis, and mortality following O. tsutsugamushi infection. Recently, O. tsutsugamushi infection has been found to cause inflammation often followed by endothelial malfunction in the lung (18, 19) . Nevertheless, most of vaccination research have focused the protective effect against mainly systemic pathologies including spleen, blood and liver (20) (21) (22) , rarely spotlighting on pulmonary immune response. Vaccination against scrub typhus via the intranasal (i.n.) route could induce an effective immune response in the lungs and systemic compartments, resulting in efficient protective immunity.",

Immunization with OMPOT provided partial protection against infection with various O. tsutsugamushi strains (27) . Therefore, we hypothesized that i.n. vaccination with OMPOT will elicit vaccine-induced immune responses by blocking O. tsutsugamushi dissemination into the lungs and inhibiting pneumonia and systemic infection by scrub typhus. Here, we found that severe lung damage was caused by O. tsutsugamushi infection, and that the protective immunity in the lung is essential for survival of mice against O. tsutsugamushi infection. vaccine efficacy were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the SNU (SNU-130111-4-2).

To ascertain whether O. tsutsugamushi is disseminated into tissues, including lungs, after the infection via i.p. route, we first examined the persistence of O. tsutsugamushi in each tissue. O. tsutsugamushi DNA was detected in the lungs and other organs including spleen, liver, and heart (Fig. 1A) . O. tsutsugamushi infection had a significant loss of body weight (Fig. 1B) , accompanied by severely hunched posture and swollen abdomen (data not shown), and did not survive at 10 days after the challenge (Fig. 1C) . Furthermore, O. tsutsugamushi-infected mice showed a lethal acute lung injury accompanied by cell recruitment with hemorrhage (Fig. 1D) . These results indicated that O. tsutsugamushi infection via the i.p. route induced pneumonia in mice, which could therefore be useful model to study the pathogenesis of O. tsutsugamushi infection and the protective response against scrub typhus.

We chose cholera toxin as an adjuvant because it has been reported as effective for i.n. vaccination that acts through stimulating Th1-as well as Th2-mediated response (6, 38) . A 4 wk after the last immunization, the mice were challenged with a lethal dose (2.4\u00d710 5 ICU) of O. tsutsugamushi. The immunized mice showed recovery of body weight loss and 100% survival ( Fig. 1B and C) with no signs of disease (data not shown). The next question was whether i.n. immunization alleviates symptoms of pneumonia caused by O. tsutsugamushi. Lungs from the immunized mice did not show any sign of inflammation, and maintained a normal lung architecture (Fig. 1D) . Taken together, these results clearly demonstrated that i.n. immunization with OMPOT provided protective immunity against lethal dose of O. tsutsugamushi.",

For this, 7 days after the last immunization, splenocytes were collected and re-stimulated with OMPOT for 16 h to determine the OMPOT-specific CD4 + T cell response. There were no significant differences in IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4 + T cells in spleen between PBS and immunized mice.

We found that the group immunized via systemic routes (s.c. or i.p.) showed a significant loss of body weight, low survival rate, and severe lung pathology similar to PBS group (Supplementary Fig. 3 On the other hand, cell-mediated immunity also plays an important role in protective immunity, especially the Th1 response, against scrub typhus (47) . Our study demonstrated that i.n. vaccination with OMPOT enhanced cell-mediated immunity, especially Th1 and Th17 responses in lungs and lymph nodes. Th1 cells appeared to play a central role in inhibiting O. tsutsugamushi growth in not only endothelium, but also macrophages and fibroblasts (48) (49) (50) . Adoptive transfer of IFN-\u03b3 producing T cells into na\u00efve mice showed a critical role of Th1 cells for the protective response (51) . However, there are no reports on the functional role of Th17 in modulating O. tsutsugamushi infection although the action of IL-17 against other intracellular pathogens such as Francisella tularensis and Chlamydia muridarum is indispensable, as a part of protective immunity (52, 53) . Further studies should examine whether vaccine-induced Th17 responses are required for protection against scrub typhus. Our data highlighted the possibility that Th1 and Th17 immunity induced by OMPOT vaccination played an important role in improving protective immunity against scrub typhus.",

Although i.p. inoculation of O. tsutsugamushi into mice has been mainly used to investigate protective immunity against Orientia infection (1,57), it did not reflect the scrub typhus-like pathology because it give rise to mainly peritonitis and not to induce systemic endothelial infection (58) . In the present study, we used i.p. challenge to develop scrub typhus in mice and found that sub-lethal and lethal dose of O. tsutsugamushi induced a lung pathology. It was supported by the findings that Orientia Ag was detected in endothelial cells in the lung from i.p.-inoculated mice that induced less pulmonary cellular infiltrate than i.v.-inoculated mice (58) .

The most interesting finding of the present study was that i.n. immunization with OMPOT uniquely induced protective immunity against a lethal dose of O. tsutsugamushi. The i.n.-immunized group showed high frequency of OMPOTspecific T cell cytokine responses in the systemic and mucosal organs, whereas s.c.-and i.p.-immunized group was not able to produce multi-functional cytokines as same as control group (Supplementary Fig. 6) . Therefore, i.n. vaccination induced a high magnitude of cellmediated immunity in both mucosal and systemic compartments when compared to those of systemic vaccination (45, 59) .",

Cellular immune responses in the respiratory tract of mice immunized with OMPOT via systemic route. Mice were immunized 3 times with OMPOT via the s.c. and i.p. route. Lungs were taken at 7 days after the last immunization (n=5). (A) Single cell suspension from the lungs was re-stimulated with 5 \u03bcg/ml of recombinant OMPOT for 16 h. Intracellular staining for IFN-\u03b3, IL-17, and TNF-\u03b1 in CD4 + CD44 hi T cells was measured by flow cytometry. The pie charts showed the cytokine combinations after OMPOT re-stimulation (B) BAL fluid and (C) lung lysates were harvested at 7 days after the last immunization and examined for the levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, IL-17, and IL-2 by using a mouse CBA Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine kit (n=5).
