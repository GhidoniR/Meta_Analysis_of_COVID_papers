Due to restricted emissions, it was hypothesized that the air quality has been improved during lockdown throughout the country. The study is intended to assess the impact of nationwide lockdown measures on air quality in Bangladesh. We analyzed satellite data for four different air pollutants (NO 2 , SO 2 , CO, and O 3 ) to assess the changes in the atmospheric concentrations of pollutants in major cities as well as across the country. In this study, the concentrations of NO 2 , SO 2 , CO, and O 3 from 1 February to 30 May of the year 2019 and 2020 were analyzed. The average SO 2 and NO 2 concentrations were decreased by 43 and 40%, respectively, while tropospheric O 3 were found to be increased with a maximum of > 7%. Among the major cities, Dhaka, Gazipur, Chattogram, and Narayanganj were found to be more influenced by the restricted emissions. In Dhaka, NO 2 and SO 2 concentrations were decreased approximately by 69 and 67%, respectively. Our analysis reveals that NO 2 concentrations are highly correlated with the regional COVID-19 cases (r = 0.74). The study concludes that the lockdown measures significantly reduced air pollution because of reduced vehicular and industrial emissions in Bangladesh.",

The current air quality index in Bangladesh is one of the lowest among the countries (rank: 166/180), leading to poor environmental performance index (rank: 162/180) (EPI 2020). Air pollution is strongly associated with respiratory diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer (Ling and van Eeden 2009; Hoek et al. 2013; Gorai et al. 2016; Guan et al. 2016) . Ischemic heart disease and stroke are also caused by air pollution (WHO 2020d) . Additionally, it has profound impacts on the transmission of infectious diseases like SARS, influenza, etc. (Cui et al. 2003; Landguth et al. 2020 ). In Bangladesh, increased air pollution is mainly caused by uncontrolled industrial emissions, vehicle exhausts, and open burning of solid wastes. Every year, a significant number of deaths have been observed due to numerous diseases linked to air pollution (Mahmood 2011) .",

Industrial sector is contributing to more than 35% of GDP, with an average growth rate of 13% per year (BER 2019). Almost all of these industries are in major cities of the country, including Dhaka, Narayanganj, Chattogram, Gazipur, Rajshahi, and Khulna (Mahmood 2011; Sabur et al. 2012) . Figure S1 depicts the spatial distribution of major industries in Bangladesh. Consequently, these cities comprise a considerable number of motorized vehicles, increasing gradually every year. For instance, in Dhaka, motor vehicle population has increased significantly with a growth rate of 7-16% in the past 10 years (Begum et al. 2008) . Table S1 shows the area and population of major cities of Bangladesh along with the observed air pollutants and number of motor vehicles. As a result, these cities have been experiencing severe air pollution problems In Bangladesh, comprehensive air pollutant emission inventory is still unavailable. Vehicular and industrial emissions are considered the major sources of air pollution in Bangladesh (Mahmood 2011) . Alam (2009) reported five industries, including food, cement/clay, pulp and paper, textile, and tobacco, contributed to about 84% of the country's total industrial air pollution in 2001. Apart from these, brick kilns also cause massive air pollution in the country, particularly in dry season (Mahmood 2011; Guttikunda and Khaliquzzaman 2014; Tusher et al. 2018) .",

According to the world air quality report (2019) by IQAir, Bangladesh was the most polluted country in 2019. Among the global megacities, Dhaka is consistently ranked as one of the top polluted capital cities. A recent study on air quality in the world's most polluted 50 cities by Rodriguez-Urrego and Rodriguez-Urrego (2020) found that Dhaka is the second most polluted cities in the world with an average annual PM 2.5 level of 97.1 \u03bcg/m 3 . Generally, the level of air pollutants varies with time and seasons. In Dhaka, the average concentrations of major air pollutants except for O 3 show strong seasonal variation, with the maximum during winter and minimum during monsoon (Rahman et al. 2019) . During the dry season (November-April), the urban areas in Bangladesh suffer from severe air quality problems. During these months, PM concentrations frequently rise to 7-8 times than the WHO standard (Rana and Khan 2020).",

A similar percentage of NO 2 reduction has been observed for Dhaka and Gazipur, ranging from 62 to 69%, while for other cities, it was~5 to 38% ( Table 2 ). Note that emission of NO 2 is strongly related to the fuel combustion in the industrial sector (e.g., power plants and small-scale heating sources) and in road transport (e.g., gasoline-powered vehicles). Therefore, it is Compared with the average NO 2 values before lockdown, Dhaka was found to be experienced with the highest NO 2 reduction (62%). Surprisingly,~5% increase in NO 2 concentration has been observed for Rangpur. We assume that the long-range transport from northern India could be the potential reason behind this increasing NO 2 .

However, a considerable reduction has also been observed in Dhaka, Narayanganj, Khulna, Rajshahi, and Gazipur, which ranged from 40.5 to 66.6% (Table 3) , as industrial zones are mostly concentrated in these cities (Sabur et al. 2012) . Therefore, the highest reduction in the SO 2 concentrations is reasonable due to the stoppage of all industrial activities and limited vehicle movements. A similar result has been observed in New Delhi (India) and Milan (Italy) where about 18 and 25.4% reduction in SO 2 concentrations were reported, respectively, during partial/total lockdown period in comparison with the prelockdown period (Mahato et al. 2020; Collivignarelli et al. 2020 ).

            "text": "The study shows that urban areas experienced a substantial reduction in CO concentration compared with rural areas, mainly due to restricted traffic movement and the shutdown of industrial activities. As high emission of CO is the result of the incomplete fuel combustion (i.e., incomplete oxidation of hydrocarbons), mainly from the automobiles (Miller 2011; Re\u015fito\u011flu et al. 2015) , therefore, a significant reduction in CO due to limited vehicle movement is reasonable. The spatiotemporal changes in CO concentrations in Bangladesh for the selected time slots are presented in Fig. 4 . Table 4 shows a noticeable decrease in CO concentrations in all major cities in Bangladesh during the lockdown period compared with before lockdown, ranging from 1.6 to > 7%. The highest reduction in CO has been observed in Narayanganj, as it is the major industrial zone with heavy congestion of commercial transportation (gasoline and diesel-powered), and other public and private vehicles. However, a considerable emission reduction has also been observed in other industrial cities (i.e., Dhaka, Gazipur, and Chattogram), where the average reduction was 5.3% (Table 4) . Similarly, while the CO concentrations during the lockdown in 2020 were compared with 2019 emission levels for the same period, relatively lower CO concentration was found during the lockdown period. These results are consistent with the findings reported for Madrid (Spain) and Delhi (India) during the lockdown period (Mahato et al. 2020; Baldasano 2020 ).",

A similar observation has been reported for Spain and Italy during the lockdown period in 2020 (Tob\u00edas et al. 2020; Coccia 2020) . Table 5 shows an increased O 3 concentration during the lockdown in all major cities in Bangladesh, with a percentage increase of 1.26 to 5%. Among all major cities, Chattogram experienced a maximum increase in O 3 concentration compared with the levels observed immediately before the lockdown (i.e., 271.95 vs. 285.75 DU), as shown in Table 5 . A similar pattern of variation in O 3 concentration is found for other major cities with an average change of 281.37 vs. 288.59 DU before and during the lockdown. Even the O 3 concentration was also found higher in all major cities during the lockdown period in 2020 compared with the 2019 levels for the same period. This increase in O 3 concentration is possibly due to the significant reduction in NO 2 concentration, which leads to more photochemical activity in the atmosphere, resulting in more O 3 production (Dang and Liao 2019; Li et al. 2019) .",

First, it might be due to the lack of proper implementation of lockdown measures in Rangpur, and second, emissions from the northern India might have considerable impacts on the reducing O 3 concentration in Rangpur, as the emissions of NO from industries and vehicles diminish the level of O 3 (titration, NO + O 3 = NO 2 + O 2 ).

In Fig. 6 , the linear regression analysis indicated that infection by COVID-19 was greatly influenced by the atmospheric concentrations of each air pollutants, while positive associations were observed with NO 2 (R 2 = 0.55), SO 2 (R 2 = 0.14), and CO (R 2 = 0.07), and negative association was found with O 3 (R 2 = 0.09). These results exhibited strong association between NO 2 , as a single predictor, with COVID-19 cases per 100,000 persons (Fig. 6) . On the other hand, the multiple linear regression model observed that all the studied air pollutants, except CO, were significantly associated with the COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh (R 2 = 0.65) (Table 6) . Similarly, Pearson's correlation matrix also showed significant interrelations among air pollutants and between COVID-19 confirmed cases with daily mean concentrations of air pollutants (Fig. 7) . Significantly positive correlations were observed among NO 2 -CO (r = 0.56****), NO 2 -SO 2 (r = 0.44***), NO 2 -COVID-19 cases (r = 0.74****), SO 2 -COVID-19 cases (r = 0.38**), CO-O 3 (r = 0.30*), and CO-COVID-19 cases (r = 0.27*), whereas significantly negative correlations were found among O 3 -SO 2 (r = \u2212 0.71****) and O 3 -COVID-19 cases (r = \u2212 0.30*) (Fig. 7) . However, statistically non-significant positive and negative relations were observed among SO 2 -CO (r = 0.03) and O 3 -NO 2 (r = \u22120.09), respectively. The higher correlation coefficient value with positive association among two air pollutants possibly exhibited mutual dependence and common pollution sources (e.g., industrial and vehicular emissions). Our findings are found to be in line with the results of other studies conducted in other COVID-19-affected cities or regions (Martelletti and Martelletti 2020; Ogen 2020; Zhu et al. 2020; Fattorini and Regoli 2020) , which clearly exhibited that atmospheric concentration of air pollutants is an important risk factor for COVID-19. It can, therefore, be stated that cities with higher concentrations of air pollutants are at high risk of COVID-19 infection. However, we could not include PM pollution in our analysis owing to data unavailability, which is one of the major air pollutants and has the potential to influence COVID-19 causality. In addition, the correlations among air pollutants imply that reduction in the atmospheric concentrations of air pollutants was the resultant effect of the enforcement of lockdown in anthropogenic activities. Several other studies (Sharma et al. 2020; Dantas et al. 2020; Kerimray et al. 2020; Mahato et al. 2020; Bao and Zhang 2020) also observed the similar types of interrelationship and reported the decreased concentrations of atmospheric NO 2 , SO 2 , and CO, while the concentration of O 3 was increased, resulting in improved air quality in the studied cities and/or the country.

The study revealed that among all pollutants, the highest average reduction was in SO 2 (i.e.,~43%) followed by NO 2 and CO during the lockdown period. On the contrary, an average increase of~3% was observed for O 3 , which we believe was due to the significant reduction in NO 2 concentration during the lockdown period.

The study also identified that NO 2 is highly correlated with the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases.",

Satellite observations are a tremendous resource for studying air quality over large geographic regions, mainly for most developing countries like Bangladesh. We believe that our study has provided a baseline scenario that will eventually help the concerned authorities for future air quality management in Bangladesh through policy reforms, mainly on industrial and vehicular emission restrictions. Moreover, it will provide the input data for regional air quality simulation. However, in our study, we did not consider the influence of meteorological conditions on air quality. As the country has distinct seasonal variations due to its geographic location, therefore, we believe meteorological parameters have a considerable influence on air quality during the pre-lockdown and lockdown period. Further study is recommended considering the impacts of meteorological conditions on air quality in Bangladesh.
