Here we characterised the effect of cholesterol arrangement, DNA structure, buffer and lipid composition on DNA-lipid binding and strand displacement. We observed that binding was inhibited below pH 4, and above 200 mM NaCl or 40 mM MgCl2, was independent of lipid type (neutral/zwitterionic), and increased with membrane cholesterol content. For simple motifs, binding yield was slightly higher for double-stranded DNA than single-stranded. For larger DNA origami tiles, 4 -8 cholesterol modifications was optimal, while edge positions and longer spacers increased yield of lipidbinding. Strand displacement achieved controlled removal of DNA tiles from membranes, but was inhibited by overhang domains, which are used to prevent cholesterol aggregation. These findings provide design guidelines for integrating strand-displacement switching with lipid-binding DNA nanostructures. This paves the way for achieving dynamic control of membrane morphology, enabling broader applications in nanomedicine and biophysics.",

Cholesterol is widely used to mediate DNA-lipid interactions, but systematic experimental studies of the kinetics and energetics of how different cholesterol-modified DNA nanostructures insert into bilayers are lacking. Generally, large numbers of hydrophobic groups are thought to be necessary for spontaneous and stable membrane insertion to occur (Krishnan et al., 2016) and to overcome the substantial energy penalties associated with the insertion of membrane-spanning DNA nanopores (22) . It has been observed that both the quantity and position of TEG-cholesterol anchors on DNA nanostructures can affect their affinity for lipid bilayers (17, 23) . The yield of well-formed lipid-DNA structures is also generally low, which limits many potential applications (21) . Monovalent and divalent cations are necessary buffer components for assembly and maintaining the stability of DNA duplexes and nanostructures (24, 25) , yet are also known to affect the physical characteristics of membrane bilayers (26, 27) and may affect the binding activity of cholesterol-modified DNA. Finally, complex regulatory mechanisms that control membrane deformation with fast kinetics are found in many biological systems, such as synaptic fusion (28) and endocytosis (29) , but are yet to developed in DNA-lipid systems.",

We have quantified the binding of cholesterol-modified DNA strands to synthetic liposomes using fluorescence microscopy, including the effects of pH, ion concentration, membrane composition and cholesterol content. We investigated three types of DNA motif: a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), double-stranded duplex (dsDNA), and a duplex with a short single-stranded DNA 'overhang' proximal to the cholesterol group, recently shown to reduce aggregation during nanostructure assembly (30) . Next, we investigated the membrane binding efficiency of a cholesterol-modified DNA origami nanostructure using fluorescence microscopy and a high throughput gel-shift assay. The effect of cholesterol number, configuration and spacer distance between the DNA nanostructure and cholesterol, were tested. We then optimised strategies for achieving reversible membrane binding by controlled removal of membranebound DNA nanostructures using toehold-mediated strand displacement. ",

In comparison, the colocalisation ratio for various cholesterol-DNA configurations across all conditions was significantly higher (CR = 1.70 \u00b1 0.36, p<0.05), confirming that specific binding of cholesterol-DNA to liposomes was observed, and that non-specific binding of plain DNA to liposomes was negligible.

Membrane-bound ssDNA has been observed to lie close to the surface of lipid bilayer membranes in fluorescence studies (48) , while dsDNA remains in a stable position protruding normal to the membrane surface (49) . Thus, the orientation difference of dsDNA compared to ssDNA may result in improved binding. The addition of a 6 nt overhang on cholesterol-tagged dsDNA strands has been proposed to assist during nanostructure assembly by inhibiting strand aggregation (30) . Inclusion of a 6 nt overhang next to the cholesterol group resulted in a minor, but significant decrease in binding only on DPhPC liposomes, and not for DOPE/DOPC. This suggests there would be no large penalty from routine incorporation of overhangs on membrane-targeting nanostructures, but possible effects arising from other lipid compositions may need to be considered.",

However, the amount of non-specific binding varied from gel to gel, and was found to vary between preparations of SUVs. Percentages of no-cholesterol tiles bound to the SUVs ranged from 15% to 60% across all the gels run in all different experiments. To control for this, our samples were always compared within gels, not between gels. Generally, microscopy experiments had smaller error ranges, while gel assays had larger errors but were higher throughput and useful for comparing large numbers of conditions.",

This is likely due to the interaction of the toehold with the cholesterol group when it is in proximity. Previous work by Ohmann and colleagues showed that an overhang placed next to a cholesterol can interact with it to reduce aggregation (30) . An increase in temperature from room temperature to 37\u02daC increased the displacement efficiency of these proximal designs, to a similar value as designs where the cholesterol was located distal to the toehold.",

            "text": "Toehold-mediated strand displacement was shown to remove DNA tiles from liposomes, by separating the tile from the cholesterol strand. In this case, the cholesterol-modified DNA strand is expected to remain docked to the liposome. For cholesterol displacement of tiles already bound to liposomes, displacement was efficient for cholesterols positioned both proximal and distal to the toehold. This is in contrast to strand displacement in the absence of liposomes, and where proximal toeholds had reduced efficiency. When the tile binds to the liposome, we expect the cholesterol to insert into the bilayer. This may result in less interaction between cholesterol and toehold, making a more accessible toehold, facilitating more efficient strand displacement (Supplementary Figure 18) . We expected to see reduced displacement efficacy for designs with shorter linkers (eg. Dt1.4 compared to Dt15.2, Pt8.5), because tight binding of the tile to the liposome may sterically hinder strand displacement. However, results here were dominated by the strong effect of linker length on initial binding yield. The short linker design had very low initial yield, comparable to non-specific binding, and so it was not possible to detect if there was a decrease on strand displacement with the gel shift technique.",

This method was found to show no bias or correlation with liposome area (percentage coverage), in comparison with Pearson's correlation, which did show such bias (Supplementary Figure 4/5). The mean pixel intensities of the DNA channel for the liposome and background areas were then compared, and used to calculate a colocalisation ratio, CR, via: Where CR is the reported colocalisation ratio, FDNA,Lipid is the mean pixel intensity of the fluorescent DNA in the liposome region of the DNA channel, and FDNA,background is the mean pixel intensity of the fluorescent DNA in the background region of the DNA channel (Supplementary Figure 3). Assembly of DNA origami nanostructures DNA sequences for DNA origami tile structure (37) were obtained using the Picasso software (Schnitzbauer et. al. 2017). The tile was folded using 10 nM of scaffold (M13mp18 ssDNA, Bayou Biolabs) and 10x excess (100 nM) of DNA staple strands (IDT) in folding buffer (5 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 12 mM MgCl2, pH 8.0) and annealed over 3 hours (80\u02daC for 15 min, then 60-4\u02daC in 56 steps at 3 min 12 sec/step). Cy5 labelled DNA strands (IDT) and cholesterol-TEG modified DNA strands (IDT) were added to staple pools prior to annealing at 200 nM (2x excess relative to staple concentration). For fluorophore attachment to cholesterol staples, 400 nM of fluorophore DNA was used (2x excess to cholesterol DNA). All staples, plain and modified, were annealed in one-pot. All sequences used are supplied in the Supplementary Data. To decorate the DNA tile with cholesterols, 21-nt ssDNA handles (H1) were designed for hybridization with complementary cholesterol-TEG modified DNA strands (C1 or C2). To quantify binding of cholesterol-DNA to the tile, strand C1 was designed with a second binding domain for hybridisation of Cy5 fluorophore labelled DNA (F1) (Figure 1B-iii). For membrane binding experiments, strand C2, without the second domain, was used (Figure 1B-i). To label the tile with fluorophores for microscopy, separate 21-nt ssDNA handles, H2 were extended from the surface of the tile for hybridisation with Cy5 labelled ssDNA F2 (Figure 1B-ii). In this design for microscopy, the number of fluorophores on the tile is independent of the number of cholesterols. The positions of H1 on the tile are given in Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure 9, and the positions of H2 are given in Supplementary Figure 8.",

Dt15.2 was observed to have both high initial membrane binding (86%) and a decrease in binding on strand displacement indicating successful displacement (39%, displaced, 36%, predisplaced). Pt8.5 had moderate initial membrane binding (61%) and successful strand displacement (18%, displaced, 15%, pre-displaced).
