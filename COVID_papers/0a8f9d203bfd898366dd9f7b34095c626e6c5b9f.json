The theoretical foundations of the analysis of communicative efficiency in the context of a \"pandemic-economic\" dilemma are proposed, possible information strategies of public authorities in a pandemic are structured, and their comparative efficiency in anticrisis management is revealed.",

It should be noted that the choice of information strategies and tactics during a pandemic depends not only on the capabilities of national health systems, the readiness of the population for selfrestraint and responsibility, and the political cycle [8] , but also on the characteristics of the structuring and institutionalizing of the system of managing the reactions of the population to COVID measures, that is, the volumes, direction, and trends of consumption of covid information, i.e., based on the theory of R.S.

However, 7 years later, his optimism about information systems for global warning was not confirmed, SCIENTIFIC but turned out to be disastrously inadequate from the standpoint of security and real risk assessment. We see a fundamentally different nature of the COVID-19 viral infection, which turns out to be much stronger in terms of the ability of the virus to transmit from person to person and the often asymptomatic course of the disease, which complicates the timely detection of cases and the course of the pandemic. However, the rethinking of the role of information structures and services in the fight against a pandemic, national communication strategies from the standpoint of assessing the effectiveness of anti-epidemiological policy is more significant in the aspect of this topic.",

This approach is typical for many European countries, in particular Germany and France, where the relevant laws have been adopted: Law On Networking Practice (2017) and Against Fake News (2018). These laws do not involve criminal punishment for individual citizens and are primarily associated with the regulation of the activities of foreign media on the territory of countries. Evaluation of communicative efficiency in the case of such a strategy is rather difficult, since it involves more significant transaction costs than in the case of a preventive strategy.
