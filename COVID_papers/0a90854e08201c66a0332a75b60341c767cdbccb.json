Malaysia reported its first imported case on 25th January 2020, and adopted a policy of extensive contact tracing and hospitalising of all cases. We describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cases nationwide and determine the risk factors associated with disease severity. Method: Clinical records of all RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases aged \u226512 years admitted to 18 designated hospitals in Malaysia between 1st February and 30th May 2020 with complete outcomes were retrieved. Epidemiological history, co-morbidities, clinical features, investigations, management and complications were captured using REDCap database. Variables were compared between mild and severe diseases. Univariate and multivariate regression were used to identify determinants for disease severity. Findings: The sample comprised of 5889 cases (median age 34 years, male 71.7%). Majority were mild (92%), and 3.3% required intensive care, with 80% admitted within the first five days. Older age ( \u226551 years), underlying chronic kidney disease and chronic pulmonary disease, fever, cough, diarrhoea, breathlessness, tachypnoea, abnormal chest radiographs and high serum CRP ( \u22655 mg/dL) on admission were significant determinants for severity ( p < 0.05). The case fatality rate was 1.2%, and the three commonest complications were liver injuries (6.7%), kidney injuries (4%), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (2.3%). Interpretations: Lower case fatality rate was possibly contributed by young cases with mild diseases and early hospitalisation. Abnormal chest radiographic findings in elderly with tachypnoea require close monitoring in the first five days to detect early deterioration. (X.C.

We selected variables from demographics, clinical histories and assessment, laboratory and imaging investigation to be included in the multivariate logistic regressions, based on clinical justification and statistical reasoning from univariate analyses. Variables from univariate analyses with p < 0.05 were recruited for the multivariate logistic regression model. Multivariate logistic regressions were performed in a stepwise approach with results from the final model reported in this study.

We reported up to 92% having mild diseases with a low case fatality rate of 1.2%. These findings were similar to other reports [ 1 , 14 , 15 ] .

In contrast, New York, China, Korea and Singapore reported a much older group of cases between 40 and 63 years. This skewed age distribution could be related to the cluster effect from 3-days religious gathering where more younger males were involved [2] . As asymptomatic transmission and presymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV2 happens, clustering effects among young males can contribute to a higher transmission rate [ 26 , 27 ] . In addition, effective contact tracing, early confinement and stringent social distancing limited the spread of disease from younger, mobile population to the elderly, as compared to overseas study [28] . This religious clustering effect was similarly noted in countries like Korea, where a sudden spike of cases occurred after a religious congregation with about 5200 followers tested positive [29] . The number of clusters reduced once mass gatherings were suspended in these countries [2] .",

We found that less than 30% of cases had a fever on admission, and this finding was similar to large cohort studies in China and New York [ 1 , 14 ] . In other coronavirus epidemics such as MERS and SARS, about 98-100% presented with fever on admission [20] . The difference in presentation among these coronavirus diseases is still being investigated, but viral tropism may be a factor [30] . When clinical endpoints were considered, there were no differences in severity of COVID-19 based on gender and ethnicity. This observation was different from the UK and US, where ethnicity was linked to disease severity [ 31 , 32 ] . The Malaysian public healthcare system is subsidised with good accessibility for both citizens and foreigners according to geographical coverage. On the contrary, even with The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) and numerous policies in the US to relieve public health burden, health disparities still prominent as evident by more African Americans had poorer COVID-19 outcomes [ 31 , 33-35 ] .",

The aetiology of kidney involvement is multifactorial with possible direct cytopathic effects on kidney tissues [47] . A review on liver injuries by Cha et al. postulated that this complication could be due to direct viral attack on hepatocyte, cytokine storm or hypoxic injury secondary to severe acute respiratory syndrome [48] . Lower incidence of ARDS compared to acute kidney and liver injuries possibly due to the nature of milder disease occurred in our young cohort [41] .",

Similarly, Gupta et al. found in a study of 2215 ICU cases in the US, the median time from onset to ICU admission was 7 days [49] . This observation is crucial as close observation for deterioration of COVID-19 cases can be implemented. Beyond this critical period, cases with lesser risk factors can be placed at a quarantine centre with less intensive care facility. Cases with higher CRP level on admission had longer ICU stay, possibly due to its correlation with the level of inflammation reflecting severe COVID-19 disease in early stage [44] .",
