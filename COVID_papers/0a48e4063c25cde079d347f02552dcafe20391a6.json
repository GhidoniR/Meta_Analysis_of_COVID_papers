In this context, the Covid-19 pandemic produced remarkable effects on those individuals prone to addictions, especially to alcohol. Alcohol is linked to multiple dangerous conditions such as social issues, severe medical conditions, and road accidents. The determination of ethylglucuronide (EtG) in hair is frequently performed to test and monitor chronic excessive alcohol intake conditions, as it allows differentiation among low-risk/moderate drinkers, and excessive/chronic drinkers. Our study aimed to explore hair EtG levels in a controlled population to assess the impact of Covid-19 lockdown on alcohol intake along March-May 2020.",

            "text": "During 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European section of WHO (1) have published several studies and report (2) (3) (4) (5) about alcohol consumption and alcohol addiction dealing with fundamental issues in preventing risks and alcoholrelated harm. In the last report published by WHO in 2020 (3), it is stated that alcohol is the primary cause of deterioration in health, disability, and premature death in Europe, which ranks first globally in terms of alcohol consumption. The impact of alcohol is mainly recorded on people of working and productive age. Thus, alcohol is a factor that might hinder economic development and represent an additional financial burden for the society, with consequences for health systems and criminal justice that largely outweigh the benefits of income tax on alcoholic products. Alcohol is not only a significant risk factor for non-communicable diseases (such as cancer and heart disease), but it also contributes to the spread of infectious diseases, and considerable increase in mental health problems, road accidents, injuries, violent accidents, and crimes (1). For these reasons, the National Alcohol Observatory for Italy (ONA) repeatedly expressed concern about the COVID-19 pandemic (https://www. epicentro.iss.it/alcol/epidemiologia-monitoraggio-2020) (6) and its impact on alcohol consumption. The 2020 ONA report states that the growth in the consumption of pure alcohol per capita between 2018 and 2019 continues to increase and has reached a level of 7 L/year (7) . An increase in the number of consumers between meals, consumers at risk, and binge drinkers (i.e., those who consume large quantities of alcohol in limited periods, for example during the weekend) has been observed, too. 14.2% of men and 6.1% of women reported that they routinely consumed excess alcoholic beverages. In Italy, 6.2 M of male consumers and 2.5 M of female consumers revealed that they did not comply with the public health indications regarding the frequency, the quantity of alcohol, and the alcohol consumption of alcoholic beverages, so that currently a total of 8.7 M individuals have to be considered \"at risk\" in Italy.",

            "text": "During the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic, WHO Europe has published the document \"Frequently asked questions about alcohol and Covid-19\" (8) concerning the relationship between the effects of alcohol and the virus spread. The WHO emphasizes that alcohol addiction during an emergency is dangerous from two points of view. First, there is an increased likelihood of being infected by the virus and adverse health outcomes since alcohol compromises the body's immune system. Severe alcohol abuse is actually a risk factor for pneumonia and other lung infections such as the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is one of the main complications of Covid-19. Secondly, rising levels of stress, isolation, withdrawal symptoms (i.e., tremors, nausea, and cravings), combined with more difficult access to services and support groups may increase people's risks with alcohol dependence. Several studies have demonstrated the correlation between exposition to catastrophic or stressful events and addiction or increase in alcohol consumption (9) (10) (11) , even if other studies do not confirm these results (12) . Adams et al. (9) investigated the relationship between alcohol consumption and mental health in the context of terrorist attacks. The results showed that binge drinking is related to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) syndromes, while alcohol dependence is related to PTSD, depression, somatization, anxiety, and low quality of life. The same results were confirmed by Lebeaut et al. (11) in a study carried out on firefighters. Boscarino et al. (10) studied alcohol abuse disorder in the period following the 11th September 2001 terroristic attack in New York, highlighting a remarkable aptitude for binge drinking in the immediate aftermath, as well as a long-term increase in alcohol consumption and addiction. However, these findings have been disproved by other studies [for instance, North et al. (12) ] that highlighted a 22% increase in PTSD in the population that survived flood disasters, often in comorbidity with depression, but they did not detect any increase or development of dependence on alcohol or other substances. Therefore, the stress arising after a traumatic event is not likely to be the only factor influencing the state of alcohol abuse and substance addiction. For instance, Wu et al. (13) identified the high degree of exposure to a virus and isolation as significant and contributing factors to alcohol abuse and substance addiction when evaluating the data collected during the SARS epidemic emergency over 3 years. Columb et al. (14) hypothesized that another influencing factor is the existence of previous states of dependence by observing an increase in the number of people turning to the help-desks for addictions during the Sars-CoV-2 (Covid-19) emergency. Consequently, the isolation and lack of distractions created by social distancing, possibly in conjunction with increased stress, anxiety, and boredom, may lead to the development of alcohol abuse disorders or relapse into pre-existing alcohol addictions (14) . A further study by the University of Padua (15) showed that 66.0% of the people answering to a diet modification questionnaire concerning the quarantine period increased the consumption of \"comfort food\". 42.7% of them declared that this increase was due to an increase in the anxiety level. Furthermore, it was reported that alcohol consumption decreased by 36.8% and increased by 10.1% of the tested population. It is essential to highlight that 78% of the study's statistical population was under 35 years old, and alcohol consumption preferentially occurs in the form of social drinking for the selected age range.",

Thus, the determination of EtG in hair is nowadays widely accepted for testing and monitoring chronic excessive alcohol intake, and it is currently employed in different areas of forensic and clinical toxicology, including workplace testing, firearms, driving license re-granting, and post-mortem investigation (17, 22, 23) . The data used in the present study have been collected at the Anti-doping and Toxicology Center \"A. Bertinaria\" of Orbassano (Torino, Italy) (24) from 2016. The hair EtG analytical results arose from samples collected from subjects who underwent medical examination within driving regranting protocols, alcohol abuse rehabilitation programs, or workplace testing.",

More in detail, the selected population includes subjects aiming to regain their driving license temporarily suspended for administrative/legal sanctions, individuals under continuous monitoring due to their ongoing or past alcohol-dependence conditions, and professional workers undergoing workplace testing. No exclusion criteria were applied in the study. Although the Center's database contains reports about the EtG levels in hair that date back to 2011, we decided to assess the impact of the Covid-19 emergency on alcohol consumption by building a dataset containing the EtG values of the last 5 years only, from 2016 to 2020, because the hair sample pre-treatment procedure was modified in the analytical protocol during the Autumn 2015. As a matter of fact, the pulverization of the keratin matrix using a ball mill in place of manual cutting produced an average 38% increase of the detected EtG level (28) , as a consequence of an improved extraction yield. The fundamental methodological details of hair analysis are available in published studies (28, 29) . To remove the methodological change bias factor from the data, the results before 2016 were not used. The EtG values measured on the samples collected during each month were averaged (April to August, 2020) and compared with the corresponding monthlyaveraged values reported in the previous 4 years (i.e., 2016-2019). This approach based on the comparison of data collected in the same month of different years was adopted because the occurrence of a seasonal variation of the average EtG values was observed in a previous study (30) .",

All the stacked barplots are available in Supplementary Figure 1.  Figure 1 also reports the same data in terms of relative percentages for the various classes of alcohol consumers. May 2020 ( Figure 1A) shows a distinct increase of the Abs subjects (+19%) with respect to the average percentage observed in 2016-2019 (i.e., 79 vs. 60%). Accordingly, lower percentages of SDr (\u221212%) and Chr (\u22127%) individuals are observed. Similar trends are evident from April and June data. In July 2020 (Figure 1B) , a slightly higher percentage of Abs (and a lower percentage of SDr) is still observed with respect to the previous years, while the percentage of Chr individuals is approximately the same.

Further evaluations were made to evaluate potential bias in the sampling of the subjects under evaluation. The individuals were divided into the following three categories: (i) DRL: those seeking driver license reinstatement, (ii) TAA: those tracked for alcohol abuse, and (iii) WT: those seeking workplace testing. The frequencies and percentages of the three types of visitors were calculated for the year 2020 and then monthly-compared with 2016-2019.

Accordingly, the number of moderate and chronic/excessive drinkers dropped, thus revealing an immediate influence on the drinking habits due to the Covid-19 lockdown of March-May 2020. Moreover, the mean EtG values showed decreasing trends in April, May, and June 2020, indicating a variation in alcohol consumption during the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic. Notably, a change in the drinking habits of the controlled population is expected to show its maximum effect after about 2-3 months, as is actually observed, due to the average rate of hair growth (1 cm/month) and the proximal 3-cm segment undergoing analysis. These results fit with the conclusions available in the literature about low-risk and social categories of drinkers (13, 40) , which consume alcohol for its socializing and pleasuring effects.",

While the average alcohol intake of social consumers was observed to decrease, on the other hand the consumption from chronic/excessive drinkers showed an alarming increment. Noteworthy, the alcoholic drinks were largely accessible during the lockdown, since supermarkets and liquor stores remained open, and delivering from on-line stores was always possible. On the other hand, bar and restaurants were shut down, thus significantly limiting the opportunities for \"social drinking\" (44) . The cogency of hair EtG as a biomarker for monitoring and retrospective analysis of average alcohol consumption has been proved once again, particularly when large population datasets are available. Future developments of this study will be addressed to the monitoring of the second surge of the Covid-19 infection and particularly concern the long-term influence of the Covid-19 emergency on alcohol addicted patients.",
