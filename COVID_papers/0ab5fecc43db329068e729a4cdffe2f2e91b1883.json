B.1.1.7 mutations in viral sequences from sewage were first identified in a sample collected in London on 10 th November 2020 and shown to rapidly increase in frequency to >95% in January 2021, in agreement with clinical data over the same period. We show that ES can provide an early warning of VOCs becoming prevalent in the population and that, as well as B.1.1.7, our method can potentially detect VOCs B.1.351 and P.1, first identified in South Africa and Brazil, respectively, and other viruses also carrying critical spike mutation E484K, known to have an effect on virus antigenicity.",

B.1.351 and P.1 variants have two more spike mutations of biological significance: E484K and K417N/T, both located in the RBD and both important for ACE-2 binding and antibody recognition. Mutations at spike amino acid 484 have been shown to reduce binding to convalescent serum antibodies with neutralization by some sera reduced >10-fold [13] . Amino acid substitutions at residue 417, K417N in B.1.351 and K417T in P.1 appear to improve evasion from antibodies in combination with N501Y and E484K [14] . More recently, mutation E484K has been identified in a small number of B.1.1.7 viruses in England [15] , raising increased concerns about this variant. The effects of mutations found in the VOCs detailed above suggest that VOCs could be a threat to the protective efficacy of current vaccines by reducing vaccine-induced immunity against them. Recent research has shown that while B.1.1.7 is modestly resistant to sera from vaccinees, B.1.351 is markedly more resistant to neutralization by such sera and some COVID-19 vaccines appear to show reduced efficacy against this variant [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Although further research is required to fully understand the effect of spike mutations on vaccine efficacy, updating vaccine strains might be required in the future in a similar manner to what is common practice for flu vaccines.",

Environmental surveillance (ES) has proven to be a sensitive method for the detection and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 circulation as described in multiple reports from many countries (reviewed in [21] ). As ES can produce a real-time snapshot of virus transmission at a given time point, including that from asymptomatic infections, it might provide precise information on the prevalence of VOCs in the population. We were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in sewage samples collected in London during the first wave of the pandemic with variation in viral RNA levels comparing to that of numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases [22] . In addition, using next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of DNA amplicons generated from sewage concentrates, we were able to track changes in variant predominance during the first stages of the pandemic detecting variants that were particularly prevalent in the UK and the rapid expansion of D614G variant reaching nearly complete dominance in May 2020 [22] . This variant, named D614G because it contains a mutation from A to G at nucleotide 23,403 resulting in amino acid change from Aspartic acid to Glycine at residue 614 of the spike protein, appeared to increase viral infectivity and transmissibility and was firstly described in late February 2020 in Italy rapidly expanding and becoming the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant globally few months later [23] . Similar work by other groups have described the detection of co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants in sewage samples from different locations including a recent report describing the identification of B.1.1.7 lineage in sewage samples from Switzerland [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] .",

The analysis of several amplicon replicates per sample is critical to reduce sampling effects and increase the accuracy of SNP determinations for viral genomes present in a given sewage sample. If we set up a conservative limit of 5% for any SNP found in any replicate amplicon sequence to be accepted as genuinely present in viral RNAs, and given that we sequenced 12 independent RNA replicates per sample and nPCR reaction, the limit of detection for detecting a sequence variant would be approximately 0.42%, which seems reasonably low for the early detection of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants of potential concern. If we consider sequencing 5% of all positive clinical samples as a minimum requirement, which is currently only achieved in a handful of countries, a 0.42% prevalence of a variant would mean finding 21 to 105 viruses among 10,000 to 50,000 new daily positive cases, respectively.

Retrospective analysis showed that the two earliest [13, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , was not detected in viral genomes from sewage. This mutation has recently been found in a small number of B.1.1.7 isolates in England but mostly in locations away from London [15] . We expect that the methods shown here can help to rapidly identify such mutants as well as B.1.351 and P.1 lineages in the same way that we have identified B.1.1.7 viruses (Table 1) . These methods can also be used to sequence SARS- up enough data representative of current transmission patterns that is comparable to that provided by ES. In addition, as most clinical testing is based on samples from symptomatic infections, a delay of several days is expected between initial infection and viral sequence data availability due to the time required for symptoms to develop, samples to be collected and PCR/sequencing analyses to be completed. Clinical surveillance is highly dependable on rapid and widespread PCR testing as well as an extensive whole-genome sequencing program. This is currently only happening in a handful of countries so, in most locations, ES could be a major asset for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 virus circulation and identifying VOCs.",

The proportion of positive PCR results for each sample was used as a semi-quantitative comparison of RNA levels present in sewage samples. The results are shown in Fig. 2 in the context of epidemiological data. As we have shown before, a sample from 14 th January 2020 was negative and only low levels of viral RNA were detected in the sample from 11 th February 2020 [22], 3 days before the first COVID-19 cases were confirmed in the area. Viral RNA concentration increased in March and April during the first wave of the pandemic and sharply declined in May as a result of nationwide lockdown measures introduced from 23rd March. Following a period of about 4 months with low level virus transmission, SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels increased again in sewage from early September in agreement with increasing COVID-19 confirmed cases. Selected PCR products NGS analysis of nPCR products for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7, B1.351 and P.1 lineages Twelve additional RNA replicates from each sewage concentrate were used to generate nPCR products with primer combinations C and D (Table S1), mapping in the spike protein gene. All amplicons from positive nPCR reactions were analysed by NGS with an aim to detect and quantify nucleotide sequence variations specifically found in B.1.1.7, B1.351 and P.1 lineages (Table 1). Nucleotide sequences characteristic of lineage B.1.1.7 were detected in sewage samples from 10 th November 2020 onwards. Mean sequence frequency values at key nucleotide positions, calculated from all sequenced replicates for each monthly sewage sample, are shown in Fig. 3. The results show that mutations discriminating B.1.1.7 lineage from ancestral isolates, which include relevant mutations coding for amino acid changes and amino acid deletions (Table 1), clearly increased in frequency between November 2020 and January 2021 from 6.84-8.88% on 10 th November to 43,99-46.36% on 8 th December 2020, 93.60-94.13% on 12 th January 2021 and 95.25-98.83% on 26 th January 2021.

One in 50 people in England (1 in 30 in London) were estimated to have had SARS-CoV-2 infection in the week ending 2 January according to an infection survey by the Office for National Statistics [30]. The third nationwide lockdown initiated on 4th January 2021 is having a clear effect at reducing virus transmission as judged by the observed drop in COVID-19 confirmed cases, but as of 26 th January 2021, SARS-levels remained high in sewage (Fig. 2) reflecting the extent of virus transmission occurring during the third wave of the COVID-19 epidemic. Although, detailed quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage and its correlation with COVID-19 infection prevalence was outside the scope of this paper and would require more frequent and widespread sampling, our results suggest that high viral RNA concentration levels could be detected preceding peaks in COVID-19 confirmed cases showing the potential predictive value of ES as it has been shown in other studies [21] . NGS analysis of DNA amplicons directly synthesized from SARS-CoV-2 RNA present in sewage concentrates from London allowed us to readily identify viruses belonging to B.1.1.7 lineage before widespread transmission of this variant was obvious. We were able to detect B.1.1.7 variant at a frequency of 6.84-8.88% in a sample collected on 10 th November 2020, few weeks before it was first noticed through clinical surveillance. B.1.1.7 variant first became apparent in late November 2020 when PHE was investigating why infection rates in Kent remained high despite national restrictions.

The frequency rates of B.1.1.7 sequences observed in sewage between November 2020 and January 2021 were very similar to those of COVID-19 cases associated with infection by B.1.1.7 viruses at around the time of sewage sample collection (Table 2). B.1.1.7 was not detected in the sewage sample from 13 th October 2020 consistent with the fact that the frequency of B.1.1.7 viruses identified in clinical samples collected in the weeks before and after 13 th October 2020 was <0.08% in the whole of England. The proportion of B.1.evidence of the presence of variants B.1.351 and P.1 was found in any of the sewage samples, which was expected as only a small number of B.1.351 isolates had been found in England at that time, not necessarily in London, and no P.1 viruses had been detected in the UK yet.

New PCRs can be quickly designed to track down new VOCs that might arise anywhere and detect importations. Furthermore, systematic sequencing of the spike gene of viral RNAs present in sewage samples collected regularly would help proactively identifying potential new VOCs based on mutations and trends encountered. Eventually, if vaccine strains need to be regularly updated as it is current practice with flu vaccines, ES could be a useful resource to help vaccine strain selection based on prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating around the world. As we show here, ES has a potential advantage for the early detection of VOCs versus clinical surveillance as it provides an immediate snapshot of virus transmission events representing thousands/millions of people, including asymptomatic infections. The methods can provide sequencing results within one week of sewage samples arriving in the laboratory. According to the GISAID sequence database [10], only 33 B.1.1.7 sequences had been identified on 16 th November 2020 in England, one week after the collection date of our first positive sewage sample.
