Reasons for this are multifactorial and complex and include protocol, patient and sponsor factors. Potential solutions to overcome issues with trial design include varied methods of recruitment with flexible inclusion criteria. Possible alternatives to randomised trials include prospective cohort studies, pragmatic trials and the use of national population-based data sets. Patient factors may be addressed by integration of geriatric assessment, so patients can be randomised or treated based on their individual needs. Additionally, standard protocols for including older adults with cognitive impairment should be developed, rather than automatic exclusion. Increased effort is needed from sponsors and governing health care bodies to make recruitment of older adults to clinical trials standard.",

This has huge implications for treatment of older adults with cancer. Firstly, there is a lack of good clinical evidence in the older age group for health care professionals and patients to make informed treatment decisions. Medical bodies such as the National Institutes for Health in the USA and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK base treatment guidelines and recommendations on trials primarily of younger adults with cancer. As a result, the medical community is providing cancer care to older adults based on evidence that was acquired in a different population: evidence typically from patients with fewer comorbidities, less polypharmacy, better overall health and different physiology [8] .",

Methods of recruitment to clinical trials may need to be tailored to older adults to overcome barriers including communication deficits, negative perceptions of potential trial participants and additional concerns from older adults [15] . Harris et al. [16] compared methods of recruitment by telephone or questionnaire to a physical activity study in 560 older adults. Telephone contact increased recruitment to the study by 10% (95% CI 0.2-19.8%), but inclusion of a questionnaire did not. Telephone contact may have given the potential study participants greater time and opportunity to speak to a research nurse and receive further information about the study if required.

[23] invited all patients who had been approached about participation in clinical trials at the gastrointestinal and lymphoma unit at their centre to complete a questionnaire about their experience. A total of 88% of 276 patients were approached and consented to participate in a clinical trial. Interestingly, increased age (C 65 years) was not a factor as to whether or not they would participate in a trial (p = 0.236), nor was performance status (p = 0.839). The most important reason for trial participation irrespective of age was a belief that 'the trial offered the best treatment available' or that 'the trial results could benefit others'. Interestingly, patients were more likely to state that their main reason for participation was 'the trial results could benefit others' if they were \\ 65 years of age compared to C 65 years (64% versus 39%). This is important to consider when approaching an older adult to participate in a trial; maintenance of their own quality of life may be the most important factor to them when considering treatment.",

There is an increasing global burden of dementia; 40-50 million people are currently living with dementia [27] , and this is predicted to double every 20 years [28] . Therefore, cognitive impairment in a patient should be treated as any other comorbidity affecting the older population [29] , and adjustments should be made to allow these patients to participate in clinical trials. Specifically when considering patients with a diagnosis of dementia, the stage of their disease journey is important. Dementia is a disease with a very long course; patients with milder disease earlier in the course are still likely to retain decisionmaking ability and should be offered trial inclusion.",

Propensity score matching was used to estimate the effect of chemotherapy on breast cancer mortality and overall survival, adjusting for differences in prognosis between those who received chemotherapy and those who did not.

Health care providers should be aware that a variety of methods may be required to recruit greater numbers of older adults, including additional staff and time spent on going through trial details, follow-up telephone calls and accessible information. When designing studies for older adults with cancer, trialists should be flexible in inclusion criteria, study design and endpoints. Patients with cognitive impairment should not be excluded from participation in trials, and consent from family or carers should be considered as routine. Geriatric assessment in some form should be embedded as standard in clinical trials of older adults with cancer. There needs to be increased pressure on sponsors to make the inclusion of older adults in clinical trials mandatory and to make the numbers recruited available in the public domain. There is an urgent need to address these issues on a global scale. Moving forward, one option is for a geriatrician to work alongside an oncologist in the context of research for older adults, similar to what is being implemented in clinical service delivery. Most importantly, older patients and their carers should be considered key stakeholders in clinical trials and actively involved in all stages of the trial process from inception.",
