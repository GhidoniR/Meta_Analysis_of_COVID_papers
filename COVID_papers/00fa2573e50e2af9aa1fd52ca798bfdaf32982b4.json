The largest decrease occurred in April 2020 (-30.4%), followed by the May to August period (-12.8%). The largest declines were observed for visits by out-of-state residents, visits classified as non-emergent, primary care treatable or preventable, and for patients diagnosed with hypertension, diabetes, headaches and migraines, mood and personality disorders, fluid and electrolyte disorders, and abdominal pain. Outpatient ED visits for emergent conditions, such as palpitations and tachycardia, open wounds, syncope and collapse remained J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof 3 relatively unchanged, while lower respiratory disease-related visits were 67.5% higher in 2020 relative to 2019, particularly from March to April 2020. However, almost all types of outpatient ED visits bounced back after May 2020. Conclusions: Overall outpatient ED visits declined from mid-March to August 2020, particularly for non-medically urgent conditions which can be treated in other more appropriate care settings. Our findings also have implications for insurers, policymakers, and other stakeholders seeking to assist patients in choosing more appropriate setting for their care during and after the pandemic.

            "text": "The spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 in spring of 2020 led to a sudden inflow of patients with acute respiratory symptoms to hospitals in the United States. Many state officials issued stay at home orders, and restricted elective medical and surgical procedures to redirect constrained hospital resources to COVID-19 patients. Uncertainty on the spread of and changing recommendations in the following months generated confusion and fear among many residents and disconnected many patients from potentially necessary health care. [1] [2] [3] One particularly hard-hit area were emergency departments (EDs), which serve as a safety net for many patients and generally treat individuals with acute conditions. However, more than one-third of all ED visits are estimated to be non-urgent and can be treated in other care settings. [4] [5] [6] Common reasons for ED utilization for non-urgent conditions include convenience and timely access to care, lack of alternatives, discrepancies in patient-provider perceptions, lapse of care management, and the need for a second-opinion. 4, 6, 7 The legal mandate to treat all patients in the ED, independent of their ability to pay, may further contribute to care seeking in such settings. 4, 6, 7 As shelter in place orders and fear of COVID-19 spread across the country, one could expect ED use to decline if people choose to forgo or postpone their non-urgent care needs or use other care settings. Although postponed or foregone care can result in impaired or even detrimental short-and long-term health outcomes, particularly for high-risk patients, reductions in care for non-urgent visits may provide the opportunity to shift resources to urgent care seekers. A current report indicates that patients are more likely to call their primary care provider or the hospital help line before deciding to seek care in the ED during the ongoing pandemic. 3 Early evidence indeed suggests that outpatient, ED visits, and hospital admissions declined by up J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof to 60% from February to April 2020 in some parts of the country, followed by a bounce back after June. 2, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] However, little is known about the composition of reductions in urgent relative to non-urgent visits.",

Similar to previous work, we allocated each visit to one of the four categories related to emergency status when the assigned probability of the algorithm was higher than 50% for said category. 17 We also analyzed visits classified separately as injury-related by the algorithm (Appendix 1).",

This implies that patients are often able to evaluate the medical urgency of their condition. 19, 20 However, for many patients ED may be the only option for care. 20 Of particular note is the relative steady trend in volume after May 2020 , though lower compared to the 2019 period, of mood and personality disorders visits. This finding could be related to the rapid uptake, expansion and reimbursement of telemedicine services during the COVID-19 pandemic, which commonly serve patients with mental health conditions. 21-23 While we cannot establish a definitive assessment on whether patients avoided emergency care for less urgent conditions, including mental health, or substituted ED care with other care settings, such as primary care or telemedicine, the results highlight the potential to divert large levels of avoidable ED visits to other care settings.

One outlier were abdominal pain conditions, which were much higher in January through March 2020 (+19.0%), strongly declined between March and April 2020 (-44.0%) and increased in June 2020 (+56.4%) to levels far above the 2019 visit counts.",

The decline was driven by a 29.6% decrease in April 2020 compared to April 2019, while the pre-and post-directive study period volumes remained similar between 2019 and 2020",

Upon further separating outpatient ED visits into 8 urgent and 8 non-urgent categories, we found that urgent lower respiratory conditions increased 6-fold in April 2020, while other non-urgent conditions decreased in volume. Although the overall volume continued to be lower in August 2020 compared to August 2019 (-11%), visits exhibited an increasing trend beginning in May that peaked in July 2020.Our results are similar in magnitude to those in a recent report on outpatient visits, which found a decline of almost 60% in March and April and a subsequent increase in visits through June.14 The sharp decline in mid-March through April can be partially explained by patients' responding to intensive communication and outreach efforts and avoiding the risks of contracting COVID-19, shutdowns, and the stay at home directive in the state of Utah from March 27 through the first week of May. Reduced mobility of residents might further explain the large declines in ED visits from out-of-state residents and reductions in visits for many medical conditions that require urgent care, but commonly occur during outdoor activities (such as sprains, strains, fractures, and superficial injuries). Uncertainty and concerns about the risk of contracting the virus may have also led patients to postpone or forego care, particularly forconditions that are less medically urgent.3 In contrast, visits for lower respiratory diseases were consistently higher beginning in early March of 2020.",
