            "text": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a prevalent complex, chronic, non-communicable disease that requires continuous multidisciplinary health care. Ongoing diabetes self-management (DSM) education is crucial for preventing acute complications, reducing the risk of long-term complications, and improving patient outcomes [1] . Proper DSM support should follow the steps of evidence-based medicine and be initiated and monitored by skilled health professionals in a consistent manner. It should follow well-designed programs that address all patient aspects and challenges [2] . services using different electronic platforms\" using the Internet [3] . It is currently an area of evolution with a possible impact on DSM. eHealth can support the exchange of medical information, improve communication, and provide patient education [4] . It shows an exceptional impact on diabetic patients who are in need of continued information and self-care, as well as frequent monitoring and regular follow-up visits [5, 6] . Understanding the interaction between eHealth and health care utilization among patients with diabetes is of great importance for constructing evidence-based regulations for better health outcomes [7] . The interaction of eHealth with diabetes care has some positive and negative impacts. Researchers have reported an increasing number of diabetic patients using eHealth with potential benefits and risks of diabetes care [8] [9] [10] . eHealth can provide essential information before or after the hospital visit or direct patients to seek medical consultation [11] . eHealth risks include retrieving inaccurate, incomplete, and nonevidence-based information, especially if the users are of low health literacy levels or if there is a lack of direct communication with their health care providers [12] [13] [14] . The risks could also include spreading rumors or misinformation and endangering patients' privacy [15] . Still, there is a need for more research from different cultural and economic settings to outline the benefits and risks of using eHealth among diabetic patients [7] .",

The first section of the questionnaire included the demographic data of the participants (age, gender, and regional area). The second section addressed the use of eHealth, which consisted of 26 closed questions that were developed and modified in accordance with the research objectives. The third section collected data on diabetes duration, treatment, frequency of visits, awareness of diabetes care (questions about type and number of point-of-care lab tests during follow-up), concerns, and satisfaction. Then, eHealth methods and applications were used to follow up and assess its association with changes in the patients' diabetic care. Patients who agreed to replace the physician consultation with eHealth modalities were considered as the eHealth-dependent group. The participants were also asked to respond to an Arabic version of the Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire (DSMQ). The DSMQ is a reliable and valid instrument for evaluating diabetes self-care behaviors in association with glycemic control [18] . The questionnaire was translated into Arabic using a standardized forward and backward translation procedure, as recommended by Bradley [19] . Participants were rated using the 16 items of the DSMQ, describing specific self-care behaviors according to their own diabetes control during the last one to five years. Rating is done based on a four-point Likert scale (from 0 \"does not apply to me\" to 3 \"applies to me very much\"; a neutral response option is not available in order to extract more specific results plus avoid of central tendency effect). The questionnaire contained 16 items: five for glucose management, four for dietary control, three for physical activity, three for health-care use, and one general question item. Of these 16 items, seven were formulated positively and nine were inversely formulated to calculate the total summation score. Then, each score was transformed into a score out of 10 (raw score/maximum score x10). Therefore, the higher the score, the better the self-management of diabetes.",

There are many possible interactions between the use of eHealth and the health care services provided by the diabetes care team. The use of eHealth might be linked to a lower number of regular physician visits [13] , as in our patients. On the contrary, information gained from the Internet might influence patients to seek medical advice, help them to discuss many important issues during their visit, or guide them after the visit for more information on emerging topics [25] .",

Moreover, the dependency on eHealth in this study was linked to the DM patients' Internet satisfaction but not to their satisfaction with the services provided by the health care professionals. This could reflect continued trust in the health system. These results are concurrent with those of previous reports [28] . Therefore, health care providers need to maintain continuity of and access to remote care and consultation with their patients. This will open the door to the use of telemedicine options in diabetes care. Telemedicine has evolved over the last decades to improve the accessibility and quality of care among patients and health care providers and to solve health care access challenges, especially during crises, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
