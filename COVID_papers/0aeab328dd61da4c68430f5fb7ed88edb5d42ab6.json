Here, we performed untargeted/targeted lipidomics and focused biochemistry on 127 patient plasma samples, and showed high levels of circulating, enzymatically active secreted phospholipase A2 Group IIA (sPLA2-IIA) in severe and fatal COVID-19 disease compared with uninfected patients or mild illness. Machine learning demonstrated that sPLA2-IIA effectively stratifies severe from fatal COVID-19 disease. We further introduce a PLA-BUN index that combines sPLA2-IIA and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) threshold levels as a critical risk factor for mitochondrial dysfunction, sustained inflammatory injury and lethal COVID-19. With the availability of clinically tested inhibitors of sPLA2-IIA, our study opens the door to a precision intervention using indices discovered here to reduce COVID-19 mortality.",

Elevated PLA2 activity in plasma of severe sepsis patients was initially described in the 1980s [24] [25] [26] [27] . These studies showed that high levels of plasma PLA2 activity (~20-fold increase) were not only sustained, but also further elevated in patients who succumbed to sepsis, suggesting distinct cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with mortality. In the present study, PLA2 activity was identified as sPLA2-IIA 28 , and deceased COVID-19 patients averaged 18.7-fold higher than normal (<10 ng/ml) with concentrations as high as 1,020 ng/ml. Forty-six percent of deceased COVID-19 patients had concentrations 10-fold or greater, and elevated sPLA2-IIA levels in patients were associated with several indices of COVID-19 disease severity (e.g., hyperglycemia, kidney dysfunction, hypoxia, anemia, and multiple organ dysfunction). These findings support that sPLA2-IIA is a central mediator in determining poor COVID-19 outcomes. Together, our data indicate that defective fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction within vital organs may not only induce inflammatory damage 32,33 , but could underly sPLA2-IIA-related COVID-19 severity and mortality.",

Additionally, clinical data availability was restricted to existing medical records, and there were missing values in the dataset. Furthermore, temporal relationships are difficult to assess as plasma sampling was not standardized. Finally, given the chaotic nature of COVID-19 management in early 2020, current standards of care may differ. In spite of these limitations, the study provides key mechanistic insights into COVID-19 mortality. It identifies sPLA2-IIA as a previously unrecognized and plausible life-threatening mechanism underlying COVID-19 severity and mortality. It also provides a clinical blueprint to identify those COVID-19 patients at risk of death and supports sPLA2-IIA as a therapeutic target.",

Consequently, structurally diverse classes of sPLA2-IIA inhibitors were developed that selectively inhibit sPLA2-IIA. Although deemed safe for clinical use, clinical trials using a sPLA2-IIA inhibitor only improved survival in sepsis patients when treatment was initiated within 18 hours of organ failure 44, 45 . Further examination of these studies' design revealed limitations: 1) patient selection criteria did not incorporate patient sPLA2-IIA levels and 2) circulating sPLA2-IIA levels were not reported in the studies. Therefore, inappropriate patient selection likely contributed to patient heterogeneity, resulting in negative findings. Indeed, a recent study reported that, using a cutoff value of 25 ng/ml, sPLA2-IIA is highly sensitive and specific in detecting sepsis 46 . Given that all deceased COVID-19 patients in our study had elevated sPLA2-IIA levels (>10 ng/ml), we propose incorporating sPLA2-IIA levels and specifically the newly identified PLA-BUN index into patient selection criteria to assess the efficacy of sPLA2-IIA inhibitors in increasing survival of severe COVID-19 patients.",

The tree split points were determined by the Gini index with the minimum leaf size = 10. A tenfold cross-validation method was used to tune the tree model and evaluate its prediction accuracy. To avoid overfitting, the tree was pruned back to the smallest size while minimizing the cross-validated error. The classification accuracy of the tree to determine each group membership (e.g., deceased vs. non-deceased) was assessed using the area under the ROC curve. To further evaluate the relative feature importance in accurately separating severe and deceased COVID-19 patients, a random forest analysis was performed using the R package randomForest 51. An assembly of 1,000 random decision trees was constructed in each forest, and 10 forests were constructed in replicate. The importance of a given feature (i.e., one of the 80 clinical indices) was assessed by the decrease of prediction accuracy when such a feature was omitted in the model, based on two measurement metrics: Gini importance or Mean Decrease Impurity (MDI), and permutation importance or Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA).
