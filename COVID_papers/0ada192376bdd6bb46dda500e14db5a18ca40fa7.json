Whether the nature of the two groups is the same but in the spectrum of different diagnostic time points is not certain. Methods: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients who needed oxygen therapy from February to November 2020 were included in the study. The patients were divided into early and late groups based on the time when the oxygen requirement occurred. Basic and epidemiologic characteristics were compared. Clinical variables were analyzed in both groups. Results: A total of 164 patients needed oxygen therapy, 94 of whom were in the early group and 70 of whom were in the late group. The early and late groups had similar baseline characteristics except age (median age, 73 vs. 67 years), uncertain exposure history (50% vs. 31.4%) and the time from the onset of illness to admission (median, 5 vs. 2 days). Multivariate analysis showed that age > 65 years (OR, 4.65), symptom onset > 5 days (OR, 9.13) and several clinical manifestations, such as febrile sensation (OR, 6.01), dyspnea (OR, 30.0), C-reactive protein > 1 mg/dL (OR, 7.87) and chest X-ray abnormality (OR, 8.15), were predictive factors in the early group. The early group required more intensive care such as mechanical ventilation care, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and death (29.8% vs. 14.3%, P = 0.002). Conclusion: Older age, especially > 65 years, and a delay of over 5 days from the onset of illness to admission were associated with early oxygen demand in COVID-19 patients. Interventions for earlier diagnosis of elderly people may benefit clinical outcomes.",

            "text": "Since December 2019, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 1 has led to a worldwide pandemic. 2 The pandemic has resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality, threatening the collapse of medical systems. The clinical course of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic to severe or critical. Most patients have mild to moderate disease (81%), but 14% have severe disease and 5% have critical disease. [3] [4] [5] Patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 can be managed well in community-treatment centers (CTCs), 6,7 but patients with severe COVID-19 require treatment at hospital settings to receive various managements, including oxygen supplementation. Therefore, it is important to recognize severe COVID-19 in a timely manner when medical resources are insufficient. One of the most important things in the management of severe COVID-19 is supplemental oxygenation therapy. 8 Some patients need oxygen therapy in the early stages of hospitalization, while others need oxygen therapy in the late stage of hospitalization. Many previous studies have identified several risk factors for severe COVID-19, such as old age, obesity, diabetes and hypertension. 9-12 However, the differences underlying an early oxygen requirement and late oxygen requirement in COVID-19 are still unknown, and there are still difficulties in managing patients who progress early during hospitalization. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there are differences in the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with an early oxygen requirement and those with a late oxygen requirement.",

Patients who were admitted directly from the community were included, and those who were referred by CTCs or other hospitals were excluded. Patients with COVID-19 were defined as having a positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test result targeting the E gene and RdRP gene of SARS-CoV-2 according to the definition of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). 13 The requirement for supplementary oxygen therapy among the COVID-19 patients was classified as 'early' versus 'late' according to the temporal urgency after hospital admission. Oxygen requirement was defined as continuous oxygen demand for more than 24 consecutive hours. The early group was defined as cases that needed oxygen therapy within 3 days of hospitalization, and the late group was defined as cases that needed oxygen therapy after > 3 days. The '3 days' was arbitrarily set up in this study considering the usual working time required for the initial evaluation. The baseline demographic and epidemiologic characteristics were compared to assess the homogeneity of the two groups. Clinical course and outcome were also compared. Outcomes were defined as the maximum level of oxygen supplementation during the entire hospitalization period, and death was defined as a case of death during hospitalization, regardless of the level of oxygen supplementation. We retrospectively collected epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory variables and underlying comorbidities using electronic medical records. However, the epidemiologic data were based on the individual formal official report made by the KCDC. For the initial clinical variables, the worst values during the first 24 hours after hospitalization were selected. Febrile sensation was subjectively expressed by patients, and objective fever was defined as an axillary temperature of 37.5\u00b0C or higher. As of November 2020, the Korean government instituted a policy requiring all COVID-19 patients to be admitted at either a CTC or hospital for isolation and clinical care immediately after the confirmation of their COVID-19 diagnosis.",

On the other hand, the early group tended to have an uncertain exposure history and was therefore not included in the active scope of tracking and diagnosis, which resulted in delayed diagnosis. There is doubt that early supportive care is beneficial in the absence of sufficiently effective specific therapeutics against COVID-19. However, our results showed that the duration from onset of illness to oxygen requirement was shorter in the early group, which suggests that early best supportive medical care is beneficial. During the study period, antibody therapy was not available, and due to the shortage, the government allowed remdesivir for patients only after the occurrence of oxygen demand. We do not use steroids in the early phase. Thus, specific therapeutics might not play a role in the improvement before the initiation of oxygen therapy. With the oxygen therapy the antiviral or anti-inflammatory treatments were more common in the early group, which might be related to the severer clinical status of the group. Clinical outcomes were also poorer, and in-hospital mortality tended to be increased in the early group.",
