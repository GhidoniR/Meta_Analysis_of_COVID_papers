The utility of developing a risk score for SARS-CoV-2 infection offers the benefits of earlier case detection, isolation of cases, and quarantine of contacts, given the disease burden associated with this infection.",

The score's performance could have been improved, with higher diagnostic ability, if different scores were derived in real-time at every phase of the epidemic and their use is updated continuously. It is remarkable that the risk score derived using a year of RT-PCR testing performed well, even though the epidemiology of the infection in Qatar has evolved immensely during this year [11, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . A month-by-month risk score, derived based on RT-PCR testing of only the previous month, would have better predicted the risk of infection month by month. With the ease of the process of deriving such risk scores, continuous updating of risk scores is feasible even in resource-limited settings, provided there is a minimal digital healthcare system to track RT-PCR testing.",

This study has some limitations. The COVID-19 risk score was derived using the national testing database rather than a nationally representative, probability-based survey of the total population of Qatar. Infection levels and patterns among tested individuals may not necessarily reflect actual levels and patterns in the wider population. The score used a small number of demographic variables, but its predictive power might have been enhanced if other variables had been available, such as more socio-demographic indicators. Despite these limitations, the study had important strengths. The testing database encompassed all RT-PCR testing done in Qatar up the present and was massive, including results of over two million tests, representing a majority of the population of Qatar [8, 39] . While other variables in the score might have improved its predictive power, they might have reduced its accessibility and utility for broad use as a tool of public health.",
