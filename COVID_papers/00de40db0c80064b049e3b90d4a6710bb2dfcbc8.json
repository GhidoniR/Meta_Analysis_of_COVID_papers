In contrast, European countries took a much more measured approach (easily confused with lack of preparedness) early on, tapping into their modelling expertise to predict the outcome of the pandemic and what the best containment strategies moving forward were. As a result, most European countries converged to suppression strategies (including everything from the shutdown BMJ Global Health of basic economic activity, in many instances enforced by hastily promulgated laws or executive orders, to the wholesale reorganisation of medical and hospital-based care) centred around non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), [4] [5] [6] fearing that pandemic mitigation would cost too many lives, with the notable exception of Sweden. 7 Interestingly, several low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) followed suit, adopting health policies informed by early modelling from developed countries, without considering how the modelling predictions might be affected by contextual factors. Modelling devoid of local context has been shown to produce far from optimal/useful projections in the Ebola, H5N1 and H1N1 pandemics/outbreaks. 2 8 For such high priority and complex topics, a participatory modelling approach seems to be particularly well suited, as it provides policymakers with timely and dynamic support, enabling the modelling process to be built around the coproduction of knowledge between modellers and policymakers. 9 This multipronged approach with collaboration among experts of different disciplines working together to incorporate all relevant contextual factors into pandemic modelling has been discussed at length in Rhodes et al. 8 Here, we describe a participatory approach to modelling that coalesced around these contextual considerations and resulted in the creation of an international consortium of infectious disease modellers and other public health experts, the COVID-19 Modelling (CoMo) Consortium. Putting in-country experts at the forefront of model development, we underscore the need to incorporate contextual factors (including population age structure, resource availability-including infrastructure, financial and human resources-and sociocultural considerations) into and iterative policy informing tool. Our approach demands a social-ecological component, composed of a combination of the contextual factors listed below be an integral part of the epidemiological model, thus addressing some of the limitations observed in other modelling exercises. 2 3 8 10 11 We appreciate a compromise between accuracy, transparency, flexibility and timeliness remains, but are confident a participatory approach is the best avenue to minimise those trade-offs.",

            "text": "Contextual factor 2: uncertainties around the characteristics of the disease As a newly emerged disease, considerable uncertainty remains around some of the basic parameters of COVID-19 infection. Evidence suggests that the median incubation period is approximately 5 (95% CI: 4.5 to 5.8) days. 19 The duration of the infectious period is extremely uncertain, with some studies suggesting that people become infectious before developing symptoms [20] [21] [22] and others finding that viral shedding in clinical cases can persist for more than 20 days. 12 23 In fact, some evidence suggests infectiousness begins before symptoms develop and is likely to peak around the time of symptom onset. [23] [24] [25] Several estimates for the serial interval (time between transmission chains), 26 27 taken together with estimates for the incubation period, strongly suggest that asymptomatically infected people can transmit the virus. A study from China found the median duration from first symptoms to dyspnoea, hospital admission and acute respiratory distress syndrome was 5, 7 and 8 days, respectively, 28 although data from New York City suggest a more rapid progression. 29 The infection fatality rate (IFR) measures the percentage of infected individuals who later succumb to the disease; a meta-analysis suggests an IFR for COVID-19 of around 0.20% (mean across all ages), given all available data as of 22 March 2020. 16 However, these estimates are full of uncertainties particularly to what concerns the denominator due to challenges in reliably ascertaining how many people are/have been infected with the virus. Two streams of scientific research are trying to resolve this underlying burden of infection: one relies on the use of inference and predictive models, 30-32 making the best use of available data to disentangle the unobserved number of infections driving the force of infection; the other focuses on diagnostic tool development to enable reliable mass serological studies to be carried out. [33] [34] [35] Reported symptomatic CFR vary widely by country, as criteria and capacity for testing can vary considerably. Burdens of comorbidity differ, as do demographics, and cause of death attribution is not uniform. Both IFR and CFR values may also be dynamic in a single setting, as delays in deaths tend to result in the underestimation of CFR early on in an epidemic, with surges in lethality during healthcare system stress.",

While these differences in approach are highly dependent on local cultural contexts and values, 42 their differential effect in the setting of COVID-19 is debated among social scientists. 43 Early empirical work is emerging suggesting disease spread was slower in countries with strong institutional systems and hierarchical cultures. 44 In China, where this novel coronavirus first emerged, a strict policy including measures such as quarantine, self-isolation and containment immediately implemented. 17 This ultimately involved strict physical distancing measures in social settings, or a 'lockdown', as Chinese local authorities imposed travel restrictions and severely restricted the movement of people. Physical distancing and isolation measures, aided by extensive testing and contact tracing, were also used effectively in South Korea to bring their COVID-19 epidemic under control. 45 Singapore undertook intensive surveillance and contact tracing, followed by isolation of suspected and confirmed cases to halt transmission chains. 35 Some Muslim countries in the Middle East have made a historical decision to cancel Friday and congregational prayers and to close their holy shrines. 46 Other countries, such as the UK, started pursuing strategies aimed at allowing herd immunity to gradually develop while reducing the demand on the health service, also known as 'flattening the curve', but did eventually enforce a strict lockdown policy. Notably, in Northern Europe, the onus of practicing efficient containment measures was transferred to the individual, while more relaxed lockdown versions were enforced, characterised by a minimal disruption to society. Several recent studies have tried to estimate the impact of these different containment/suppression strategies in different countries, 4 47-52 but little insight has been gained into the optimal long term strategy, assuming that a vaccine may not be available before the end of the year.",

While these consortia mainly inform policy in HICs, they often act as external service providers to LMICs. Modelling inputs to LMICs have, therefore, generally involved two groups of professionals: modellers from HICs and policymakers from LMICs; a situation which is far from ideal. We sought to avoid this by adopting a participatory approach when establishing the international CoMo Consortium. A participatory approach is key for policymakers to fully appreciate the uncertainties subjacent to assumed parameter values, implemented mechanisms of action and general model structure. The immediate consequence of that understanding is clarity on the relevance of critical data in circumventing uncertainties, and the understanding that continual validation frameworks are key to guarantee the best possible policy is implemented at all times. The use of a participatory approach can even be viewed as part of the intervention package, as argued in other studies, 3 and is highly desirable, 54 as evidenced by the number of policymakers from multiple countries around the world who have requested to actively participate in the CoMo Consortium.

A standalone Excel-based tool, the Cornell COVID-19 Caseload Calculator with Capacity and Ventilators model, formed the basis for the healthcare components of the CoMo Consortium model. 56 From inception, the goal was to allow the user to define critical aspects of the model structure, model inputs, both in terms of parameter values and interventions considered, interface options and output reporting. This was key to the model being well accepted and easily adopted by so many different countries.",

We cannot emphasise enough how critical the role played by the in-country experts is. It falls on them to engage with policymakers and explain to them the features and capabilities of the model, guide them in addressing appropriate modelling questions, and later package those questions alongside all relevant contextual factors to the technical team to ensure the model can represent the desired context appropriately.

This raised serious concerns on how countries with lower health capacity would fare, specifically to what concerns the number of available intensive care unit beds and ventilators. As a consequence, we invested quite some time developing the hospital submodel and have made it a central point of discussion with in-country modellers, as it is their role to assess the current and likely health capacity in their country and convey the message of how those limitations impact on the predicted epidemic mortality burden to their respective policymakers. \u25ba In Afghanistan and Timor-Leste there was a lot of concern regarding the role of migrants in causing local outbreaks and seed local transmission. This led to the addition of a user defined parameter setting the number of daily imported infections. \u25ba Interventions are not implemented in the same way everywhere, as country contextual idiosyncrasies critically affect the potential efficiency and practicability of any intervention.",

In LMICs that is not that case, for the reasons highlighted above. Due to these issues with household structures, in Thailand, the ministry of health decided to isolate people fitting a clinical algorithm in governmental facilities, where they were kept for up to 14 days, or until they test negative for the virus. This type of testing centre was implemented early on in South Korea and Singapore to great effect. The stage of engagement with local policymakers is quite heterogeneous across CoMo Consortium members (table 2) . Members with existing channels of communication with Ministries of Health have gone through the process of providing feedback to their relevant authorities at a much faster rate. Some members of the academic community have needed to foster links with appropriate points of contact at Ministries of Health, specially appointed government entities, or COVID-19 taskforces, and establish appropriate channels of communication and gain the trust of policymakers. In some instances, it has been necessary for members to navigate a complex landscape, sometimes involving finding consensus among several different modelling groups offering advice to their government.",

Importantly, this continuous cooperation and feedback loop has been a valuable part of the process to facilitate collaboration and develop trust. A static online tool alone would not be sufficient to achieve this. The biggest strength of participatory approaches can ultimately be its largest limitation, as everything is reliant of the in-country expert being able to reach policymakers and/or gain access to the relevant data, perform data quality control, and liaise with the model development team to ensure the interventions being implemented in the field are well captured in the model.",
