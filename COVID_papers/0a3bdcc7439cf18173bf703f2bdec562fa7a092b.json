Since then, the number of cases has continued to grow with the regular occurrence of new community cases. Even though pregnant women are not among the risk groups linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, they can still be infected with harmful consequences on pregnancy. After 3 months of presence in Senegal, it becomes important to investigate the association COVID-19 and pregnancy in Senegal. The objective of this paper is to investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy.",

All the patients presented with a headache and only four of them had fever without chills. Other symptoms were also observed: two patients had a cough, two had rhinorrhea, and two patients reported poor appetite. The diagnosis was confirmed by PCR for all pregnant women. Three out of nine patients were administered hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. The median time to recovery was 13.6 days. Patients\u00b4 characteristics, treatment and outcomes are displayed in Table 1 . The pregnancy outcome was fortunate for 8 out of the nine pregnant women. The youngest 18-year-old patient had experienced bleeding from the start of her hospitalization. Complete miscarriage was then diagnosed. Currently, all of the patients in our series benefit from regular pregnancy follow-up as part of the refocused antenatal care program. None of the nine pregnant women developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of May 15th, 2020.",

Thousands of articles were published worldwide in 4 months; and this paper on a series of pregnant women is one of the first carried out in sub-Saharan Africa. The average age of the patients in our group was lower than those found in the literature [2] . No woman had yet given birth in our series. Logic would suggest, as with other infectious diseases, that maternal physiological changes, lowered immunity, and changes in the cardiopulmonary physiology of pregnancy are responsible for high sensitivity to SARS-COV-2 infection [3, 4] . However, no serious form was found in our series. Our results are consistent with those of several studies which have shown that pregnant women have the same symptoms of COVID-19 as the general population [4] [5] [6] . Indeed, Chen et al. [5] , out of a series of 9 pregnant women, reported no cases of pneumonia or of a critical form, although they all gave birth by cesarean section.",

The preterm birth rate was 46% and cesarean section rate was also high in this group of 13 patients (77%). One patient was operated on for ARDS with hepatocellular insufficiency and stillbirth at 34 weeks. As for Zhu et al. [7] , after an analysis of a series of 9 patients in Hubei hospitals, found that patients with pneumonia would be more at risk of premature rupture of the membranes, premature deliveries, fetal deaths in utero, delays intrauterine growth and neonatal death. Zhu's findings are also supported by other authors [8, 9, 10] . No termination of pregnancy was required in our series. The spontaneous miscarriage in the series cannot be linked to COVID-19; she had flu-like illness in early pregnancy, requiring hospitalization. As the patients are followed, amniotic fluid samples from patients with COVID-19 will be obtained via direct syringe aspiration at the time of delivery. Cord blood and neonatal throat swab samples will be collected immediately after delivery. Additionally, we will collect breastmilk samples from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia after their first lactation. Evidence of motherto-child transmission will then be evaluated by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in these clinical samples.",
