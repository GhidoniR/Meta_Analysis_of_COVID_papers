Qatar has a unique population, in that the over 90% of the residents are economic immigrants from other countries. 25 The concerns and priorities of this migrant-majority population, who do not live with their wider families or elderly relatives and are keen to return back to economic activity, are likely to differ. We anticipated that the motivations for accepting vaccines will therefore be different in Qatar compared to the native majority populations studied to date. Additionally, there are no studies on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy from Qatar and the wider MENA region, with similar demographic characteristics, to our knowledge. Therefore, it is important to explore attitudes toward vaccination and the degree and nature of potential vaccine refusal. We carried out a national cross-sectional survey of adults in the State of Qatar to measure attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination using a validated vaccine hesitancy tool and to study socio-demographic and personality characteristics associated with vaccine hesitancy. In this article, we present a subset of the findings of the wider study focusing on the degree of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its sociodemographic correlates.",

            "text": "This is one of the largest population-based studies, to date, that addresses attitudes toward vaccination in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, this is the first study in the Middle East and Northern African (MENA) region looking at the attitudes to the prospective COVID-19 vaccine in a majority economic immigrant population using validated instruments that measure vaccine hesitancy within the SAGE framework. The main finding of this study is that as many as 20% of those surveyed showed hesitancy toward getting vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine and a further 20% were unsure whether they would accept the vaccination or not.To put this in perspective, emerging evidence from the few studies that have investigated COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy needs to be rates across the countries and regions.22 From the emerging evidence, it appears that the rates of hesitancy are relatively higher in high-income countries compared to medium income countries. The medium-income countries also show more trust in their governments which may be associated with higher acceptance rates.21,22 Qatar is overall hesitancy rate which is somewhat lower than the global aggregate rates. It is possible that the migrant group sees vaccination as a means to return to full economic activity. Additionally, most of these economic migrants are young working age men who do not have families living with them in Qatar and do not have to worry",
