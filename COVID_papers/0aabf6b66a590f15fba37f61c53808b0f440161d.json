A novel coronavirus was isolated and it was seen that the virus had 79.5% nucleotide sequence homology to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the 2003 SARS outbreak agent [2] . Moreover, as the disease swept across 213 countries, the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced the situation as a pandemic on March 11, 2020 , and right after identified the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced diseases as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [3] . Despite restrictions in most countries, the confirmed number of cases has been rising worldwide. As of today (December 8, 2020), according to WHO data, 66.7 million confirmed cases and 1.54 million deaths from COVID-19 have been reported worldwide [4] .",

Platelet count is known to be independently associated with risk of mortality in ICU, and lower platelet count is involved in various disease severity scores as a risk factor. Also, thrombocytopenia was shown to be associated with three times increased risk of severe COVID-19. This might be either the result of a direct effect on platelets or a systemic inflammation process [18] . Zhao et al. compared the platelet counts on the fifth to sixth day and on the 14th to 15th day between survivors and non-survivors of both genders and found that the mean value of platelet count of survivors was significantly higher than that of non-survivors on the fifth to sixth day (p=0.003) and the 14 to 15th day (p<0.001) of male patients and on the 14 to 15th day (p=0.001) of female patients [19] .

Third, patients enrolled in our study mostly come from Istanbul, and large-scale studies at the national level are needed to provide more reliable and comprehensive data. Fourth, changes in the illness in different subtypes need to be further investigated. A model for predicting the changes of disease is necessary for clinicians to better guide treatments.

Patients with mild symptoms or symptomless exposure history were examined at an individual zone, whereas patients above 18 years of age with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) symptoms were admitted into the respiratory red zone designated for possible COVID-19 cases.

If patients were thought to have COVID-19, based on their signs, symptoms, and CT scan, they were referred to infectious diseases for the decision of ward or intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RT-PCR swabs for those patients were obtained immediately after admission, unless obtained and readily available before admission.
