Healthcare staff, especially nurses, experience a great deal of psychological distress during care of COVID-19 patients. Detecting factors that disturb nurses' mental health during care of these patients can help to reduce their psychological distress. Therefore, this study aimed to explore nurses' experiences of psychological distress during care of patients with COVID-19. Methods: The present qualitative research was performed using the conventional content analysis method in Iran from March to May 2020. Participants in this study included the nurses caring for patients with COVID-19, and they were selected based on the purposeful sampling method. The data was collected through 20 phone call interviews and analyzed based on the method proposed by Lundman and Graneheim.",

In Iran, until May 30, 2020, the number of people contracting the virus was 148,950 with the death toll standing on 7734 [3] . Around 20% of COVID-19 patients may experience severe symptoms necessitating oxygen therapy or other inpatient interventions, and only 5% of them require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) [4] .",

These problems include an increasing need for medical staff; increasing costs for personal protective equipment (PPE), diagnostic tests, beds and ventilators, as well as rising mortality [7, 8] . Nevertheless, many health care workers are at the risk of contracting the virus and even death, and it is largely impossible to reduce this threat to zero [9] .

Among health staff, nurses are among the most involved in fighting against the COVID-19. Actually, they regularly are in direct contact with patients from the time of admission to the discharge. Therefore, nurses are highly exposed to psychological distress compared to other health workers during the pandemic [14] . The nurses providing intensive and ongoing health services during previous epidemics had been reported to experience the highest level of job stress and mental distress compared to other treatment staff [15] . Lorestan, as one of the overcrowded provinces of Iran, is located in the western region of the country. Like other parts of the world, the prevalence of the COVID-19 in this province has been increasing since its emergence. Lorestan province has 11 cities with a population of 1,760,000, and its capital is Khorramabad. Eighteen hospitals affiliated to Lorestan University of Medical Sciences are responsible for delivering healthcare to the patients across the province. During the COVID-19 outbreak, Shohaday-e-Ashayer Hospital, as one of the most important hospitals of the province with 350 active beds, was considered as the central site for managing COVID-19 patients. Other counties also allocated parts of their capacities for taking care of patients with COVID-19. According to formal statistics, 1981 nurses are at the frontline of providing care to COVID-19 patients in this province [16] . Therefore, based on the nature of qualitative research which aims to find root problems, and the fact that the researchers are experts on qualitative research methodology, we decided to conduct a qualitative study to explore nurses' experiences of psychological distress during care of patients with COVID-19. Recognizing the factors affecting nurses' mental health can help to create a safer workplace for them.",

Initially, the characteristics of the nurses working in COVID-19 wards were gathered by looking at their profiles available at the hospitals' nursing offices. Afterwards, we contacted the participants during their off-times. After explaining the study objectives and acquiring verbal consent from the selected nurses by the first author, a proper time to carry out the interview was agreed with the participant. The duration of the interview was decided based on the nurses' convenience, tolerance, and working experience. An electronic device was used to record all the interviews. The participants were asked some key questions as \"Please describe a day of taking care of hospitalized patients with COVID-19\", and \"Please talk about your unpleasant experiences\". The interview continued according to the answers provided by the participant, and based on these answers, more in-depth questions such as \"what do you mean?\", and \"please explain more about this\" were asked.",

Semantic units were groups of words or sentences which gave an identical meaning or were relevant to the same concept in some ways. Accordingly, semantic units were condensed and coded.

Several evidences indicate that people have low adherence to self-quarantine and preventive recommendations [39, 40] . Overlooking these recommendations can increase the risk of propagating the disease throughout the community. In this regard, it is necessary to direct people to accept social responsibilities about the health of other members of the society and present health recommendations to them based on behavior-changing theories. Mass media networks by showing entertaining programs should also encourage people to stay at home. Of course, one of the major concerns of people, that leads them to ignore health instructions, is the economic crisis. Therefore, with financial support of poor people and providing fun programs through mass media, it is possible to encourage people to stay at homes and adherence to health instructions.",

            "text": "The nurses' experiences in this study showed that they endured a great deal of psychological distress during care of patients with COVID-19. The sources of such distress were related to patients' death, the disease's unknown dimensions, the atmosphere of the working environment, professional commitments, and individual characteristics. During outbreaks of diseases and/or natural disasters and in accordance with their professional duties and missions, nurses actively provide health services for people from the beginning of crises. In order to boost nurses' mental wellbeing, there is a need for support from decision and policy makers and governments during and after such events. If no support is provided, nurses' workforce will be degraded, which can deliver the health system vulnerable to the crisis. Paying attention to the experiences of nurses during the coronavirus pandemic is a prerequisite for providing health cares and improving their quality. For maximum-quality health care services during pandemics, governments and health systems should minimize nurses' mental burden by delivering adequate personal protection equipment, strengthening mutual support among health team members, providing psychological counseling, and delivering timely information and educational supports. Encouraging people to adhere to health instructions and to stay at home can reduce the disease propagation and the workload of nurses and improve their mental health. Holding training workshops on how to cope with the current crisis, encouraging nurses to listen to each other's concerns, and preventing negative news from being spread among health care workers can also improve nurses' mental health. It is recommended to conduct more research on how to improve nurses' mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak. ",
