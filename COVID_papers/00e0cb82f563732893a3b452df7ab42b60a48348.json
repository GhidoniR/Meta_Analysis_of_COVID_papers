            "text": "The vast majority of ovarian cancer patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, and despite all treatment options, ovarian cancer remains the most lethal cancer among gynecological neoplasms. 1 The standard treatment of ovarian cancer is cytoreductive surgery followed by intravenous chemotherapy, however, in recent years cytoreductive surgery plus hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) may potentiate the therapeutic efficacy. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of HIPEC on survival in ovarian cancer patients has not been proven in prospective studies. 2 3 According to the results of a phase III study conducted in patients with recurrent ovarian cancers, although including a limited number of patients, the favorable impact of cytoreductive surgery plus HIPEC on survival compared with the application of cytoreduction alone was reported. 4 Also, van Driel et al showed that the addition of HIPEC to interval cytoreduction in ovarian cancers improves survival. 3 Recently, outcomes obtained from these studies have encouraged clinicians to use HIPEC after cytoreduction and it has become a standard practice after interval cytoreduction in many centers. [2] [3] [4] The increasing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has also brought regulations in gynecological oncology. With the recommendation of the European Society of Gynecological Oncology, cytoreductive surgery performed in an advanced stage or recurrent ovarian cancers has been evaluated as semiurgent, and it has been proposed that surgery may be performed within 1-4 weeks. 5 Also, the European Society of Medical Oncology stated that considering the risk-benefit ratio for patients during the pandemic period, cytoreductive surgery in ovarian cancer may be delayed up to 6 weeks at the latest. 6 However, it was emphasized to refer patients to a COVID-19free comprehensive cancer center specializing in the treatment of gynecological malignancies. 6 On the other hand, the FRANCOGYN group recommended that, in order to avoid postoperative complications and possible issues such as hospital bed occupancy and intensive care unit support, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with the increased number of cycles, should be given priority in ovarian cancers, and HIPEC should not be performed unless the hospital conditions are suitable in the COVID-19 period. 7",

HIPEC was applied at 41.5\u00b0C-42.5\u00b0C constant temperature for 60 min with dosages of carboplatin (area under the curve 5 or 6), cisplatin as 75-80 mg/m 2 (at the condition of glomerular filtration rate >100 mL/min), and mitomycin as 30 mg/m 2 .",

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy shoud be given priority in patients with increased risk of major postoperative complications (advanced age, obesity, severe cardiovascular pathology, ASA III or IV risk). However, it should be noted that neoadjuvant chemotherapy over six cycles may delay interval surgery. For each case, the decision for the use of HIPEC should be made in expert centers by multidisciplinary consensus. 9 In a study comparing gynecological cancer surgeries performed before and during the pandemic, complications in the first 30-day postoperatively were found to be higher during the pandemic, which was especially apparent in the first 3 months. [17] [18] [19] Also, median hospital stay and rate of bowel resection with stoma requirement were similar to the findings reported in patients who underwent cytoreduction plus HIPEC before the pandemic. 20 21 Although only one morbidity was observed among the patients who underwent HIPEC in the study, morbidities due to COVID-19 infection in other gyne-oncological surgeries were also observed in our study centers.",
