In France, for instance, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 is now >10% in dialysis patients, with a mortality rate of about 15% in those who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).",

Of the 132 eligible patients (mean age, 67.54 AE 15.71 years; 57% males; average dialysis vintage, 2.21 years), 101 (77%) gave their consent to be vaccinated (Table 1) . At baseline, only 2 patients tested positive (anti-S IgGs, 1200 and 22 U/ml, respectively). Both had previously had symptomatic COVID-19. At T1, only 35 (35%) of the patients had developed neutralizing antibodies, with a median titer of 8.22 U/ml [interquartile range, 1.73-28.70] (Figure 1 ). The patients who developed neutralizing antibodies were younger and had a lower comorbidity burden (Table 1) . However, in this subset of cases, no correlation was found between antibody titer and age, comorbidity, or dialysis vintage.",

At difference with other recent reports in health care workers, 7 our data suggest that only about one-third of hemodialysis patients develop neutralizing antibodies after the first dose of BNT162b2 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, and that these are at low titers, as could be expected, in a highcomorbidity cohort (median Charlson Comorbidity Index: 8). Younger patients, with lower comorbidity, are more likely to mount an antibody response. Although, because of a shortage of vaccine, some institutions proposed a policy of delayed second-dose administration in the general population, 8, 9 a timely second dose of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine seems necessary to ensure protection in hemodialysis patients.
