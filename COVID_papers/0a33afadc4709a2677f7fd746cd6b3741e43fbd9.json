            "text": "A decision maker usually holds various viewpoints regarding the priorities of criteria, which complicates the decision making process. To overcome this concern, in this study, a diversified AHP-tree approach was proposed. In the proposed diversified AHP-tree approach, the judgement matrix of a decision maker is decomposed into several subjudgement matrices, which are more consistent than the original judgement matrix and represent diverse viewpoints on the relative priorities of criteria. Thus, a nonlinear programming model was established and optimized, for which a genetic algorithm is designed. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed diversified AHP-tree approach, it was applied to a supplier selection problem. The experimental results showed that the application of the diversified AHP-tree approach enabled the selection of multiple diversified suppliers from a single judgement matrix. Furthermore, all suppliers selected using the diversified AHP-tree approach were somewhat ideal.",

            "text": "An analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a recognized technique in multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) (Akg\u00fcn and Erdal 2019; Dilawar et al. 2019; . AHP is based on a decision maker's judgment matrix, which summarizes the pairwise comparison results of the relative priorities of criteria (Saaty 2008) . However, since only two criteria are compared each time, it is not easy to make all pairwise comparison results fully consistent (Ben\u00edtez et al. 2011; Ami et al. 2018) . To overcome this difficulty, an intuitive approach is to ask the decision maker to modify his/her pairwise comparison results (Lin and Yang 1996) . However, such a treatment may go against his/her wishes. If more pairwise comparisons are to be made, it is more difficult to maintain consistency. For this reason, Wedley (1993) recommended that a decision maker made only some pairwise comparisons. Then, the results of other pairwise comparisons were estimated. Soliciting opinions from multiple decision makers is a viable way to enhance consistency (Moreno-Jim\u00e9nez et al. 2008; Krivulin 2020) . Xu (2000) and Escobar et al. (2004) applied the weighted geometric mean method to aggregate multiple decision makers' judgment matrixes. The experimental results showed that consistency has improved after aggregation. Ben\u00edtez et al. (2011) proposed an algorithm that can automatically modify a judgment matrix slightly to make it more consistent. Some studies suggested using different indicators (e.g., geometric consistency index, the index of determinants, harmonic consistency index, etc.) to measure consistency (or inconsistency) to increase the likelihood that a judgment matrix is consistent (Wedley 1993; Wang and Chen 2008 ; Business Performance Management Singapore 2013; Franek and Kresta 2014; Liu et al. 2017; Pel\u00e1ez et al. 2018 ). However, these treatments have changed the original rules of AHP, which may be unacceptable. In addition, there is still a need to find a way to improve consistency without asking a decision maker to modify his/her pairwise comparison results, compromise with others, or change the method of measuring consistency Chen et al. 2020) . To this end, a diversified AHP-tree approach is proposed in this study.",

To address this issue, a decision maker's judgement matrix is decomposed into several subjudgement matrices, and each subjudgement matrix represents a single viewpoint of the decision maker when comparing criteria. A subjudgement matrix should be more consistent than the original judgement matrix, because there is no need to trade off various points of view. In addition, a subjudgement matrix can be further decomposed into its subjudgement matrices. Finally, a judgement matrix is decomposed into a tree comprising numerous subjudgement matrices. The priorities of criteria determined by these subjudgement matrix will be different.",

In addition, the decomposition process is repeated until a sufficient number of viewpoints have been manifested. The result shows a tree-like structure of subjudgement matrices, which is termed a subjudgement tree or an AHP tree. Based on each subjudgement matrix, the priorities of criteria can be set, and then the best alternative is selected based on these priorities. Finally, many alternatives that are simultaneously optimal from various viewpoints can be chosen. For example, Fig. 1 shows nine judgement and subjudgement matrices.
